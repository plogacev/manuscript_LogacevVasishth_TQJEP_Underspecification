@article{Pelz:2001p267,
abstract = {While we know a great deal about the dynamics and characteristics of eye movements in relatively simple tasks performed under reduced laboratory conditions, we know less about oculomotor behavior in complex, multi-step tasks. Complex tasks are not necessarily difficult. Part of the transition from 'hard' to 'easy' in completing complex tasks is the gradual reduction in conscious effort required to complete the sub-tasks. We are interested in learning whether high-level perceptual strategies can aid that transition. In the past, subjects performed relatively simple tasks or the eye movements themselves were the instructed task. But outside the laboratory vision is a tool, not the task. To study the oculomotor system in its native mode, we developed a wearable eyetracker that allows natural eye, head and whole-body movements. Using the over-learned, common task of hand-washing, we measured the global characteristics of fixation duration, saccade amplitude, and the spatial distribution of fixation positions. An important observation was the emergence of higher-order perceptual strategies in the complex task: while most fixations were related to the immediate action, a small number of fixations were made to objects relevant only to future actions. Based on a control task that differed only in the high-level goal, we conclude that the look-ahead fixations represent a task-dependent strategy, not a general behavior elicited by the salience or conspicuity of objects in the environment. We propose that the strategy of looking ahead to objects of future relevance supports the conscious percept of an environment seamless in time as well as in space.},

abstract = {A normative study and an eye-tracking experiment investigated the influence of animacy on the processing of subject and object relative clauses in Spanish. The results showed that object relative clauses caused more difficulty than subject relative clauses, but that animacy modulated this preference. The overall pattern was similar to findings in other languages. However, because of the syntactic characteristics of Spanish relative clauses, the results give novel insights into the processing mechanisms that underlie relative clause processing.},

Current methods for file transfer do not scale well for large files and can cause long transfer times. In this study we present BioTorrents, a website that allows open access sharing of scientific data and uses the popular BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing technology. BioTorrents allows files to be transferred rapidly due to the sharing of bandwidth across multiple institutions and provides more reliable file transfers due to the built-in error checking of the file sharing technology. BioTorrents contains multiple features, including keyword searching, category browsing, RSS feeds, torrent comments, and a discussion forum. BioTorrents is available at http://www.biotorrents.net.},

abstract = {Within-subject ANOVAs are a powerful tool to analyze data because the variance associated todifferences between the participants is removed from the analysis. Hence, small differences,when present for most of the participants, can be significant even when the participants are verydifferent from one another. Yet, graphs showing standard error or confidence interval bars aremisleading since these bars include the between-subject variability. Loftus and Masson (1994)noticed this fact and proposed an alternate method to compute the error bars. However, i) theirapproach requires that the ANOVA be performed first, which is paradoxical since a graph is anaid to decide whether to perform analyses or not; ii) their method provides a single error bar forall the conditions, masking information such as the heterogeneity of variances across conditions;iii) the method proposed is difficult to implement in commonly-used graphing software. Herewe propose a simple alternative and sow how it can be implemented in SPSS.},

abstract = {We reexamine the empirical record of the comprehension abilities of
Broca's aphasic patients. We establish clear, commonly accepted,
selection criteria and obtain a pool of results. We then subject
these results to a detailed statistical analysis and show that these
patients comprehend certain canonical sentences (actives, subject
relatives, and clefts with agentive predicates) at above-chance levels,
whereas comprehension of sentences that contain deviations from canonicity
(passives, object-gap relatives, and clefts) is distinct and is at
chance. That the latter is the case, and patients indeed guess at
such structures, we show by comparing the distribution of individual
results in passive comprehension to that of a model for such guessing-an
analogous series of tosses of an unbiased coin. The two distributions
are virtually identical. We conclude that the group's performance
is stable, and well-delineated, despite intersubject variation whose
source is now identified. This means that certain comprehension tests
may not always be used for the diagnosis of individual patients,
but they do characterize the group. It also means that group studies
are not just a valid option in neuropsychology; they are a must,
since demonstrations like ours indiciate very clearly that single-case
studies may be misleading. As we show, the findings from any one
patient, without the context of a group, may give a distorted picture
of the pathological reality. Our conclusions thus promote studies
of groups of brain-damaged patients as a central tool for the investigation
of brain/behavior relations.},

Rev. 63 (1956) 81-97.], the magical number seven, plus minus two, and high-speed scanning in human memory ¿S. Sternberg, High speed scanning in human memory, Science 153 (1966) 652-654., Lisman and collaborators [O. Jensen, J.E. Lisman, An oscillatory short-term memory buffer model can account for data on the Sternberg task, J. Neurosci. 18 (1998) 10688-10699; J.E. Lisman, M.A.P. Idiart, Storage of 7+/-2 short-term memories in oscillatory subcycles, Science 267 (1995), 1512-1515.] proposed an oscillatory short-term memory buffer model. In this neurophysiological model: "a single brain network can separately maintain up to seven memories by a multiplexing mechanism that uses theta and gamma brain oscillations for clocking. A memory is represented by groups of neurons that fire in the same gamma cycle" ¿O. Jensen, J.E. Lisman, An oscillatory short-term memory buffer model can account for data on the Sternberg task, J. Neurosci. 18 (1998) 10688-10699, p. 10688. To test this model, we tried to modify the memory scanning time by shifting the gamma oscillation frequency. To this aim, we replicated the visual short-term memory scanning task ¿S. Sternberg, High speed scanning in human memory, Science 153 (1966) 652-654., and we simultaneously used the protocol that Treisman ¿M. Treisman, A. Faulkner, P.L.N. Naish, D. Brogan, The internal clock: evidence for a temporal oscillator underlying time perception with some estimates of its characteristics frequency, Perception 19 (1990) 705-743. designed to drive, slowing down or speeding up, a temporal oscillator acting in the gamma range ¿J.G.R. Jefferys, R.D. Traub, M.A. Whittington, Neuronal networks for induced "40 Hz rhythms, Trends Neurosci. 19 (1996) 202-208; W. MacKay, Synchronized neuronal oscillations and their role in motor processes, Trends Cog. Sci. 1 (1997) 176-183; M. Treisman, N. Cook, P.L.N. Naish, J.K. MacCrone, The internal clock: electroencephalographic evidence for oscillatory processes underlying time perception, Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 47A (1994) 241-289.. In this protocol, an auditory periodic stimulus (click train) was delivered at various frequencies during the task. The reaction time (RT), the slope, and the intercept of the linear function associating RT to memorized list length showed systematic modulations according to the stimulation frequency. The predicted driving effects due to the click trains were obtained, consisting of localised modulations of performance on the stimulation frequency band. We argue that memory scanning is indeed paced by a temporal oscillator, thus providing behavioral arguments for the serial oscillatory model of Lisman.},

We show that for Posner cuing with saccadic responses, microsaccades go with attention in at least 75\% of cases (almost 90\% if probability matching is assumed) when they are first (or only) microsaccades in the cue--target interval and when they occur between 200 and 400 msec after the cue. The relation between spatial attention and the direction of microsaccades drops to chance level for unselected microsaccades collected during manual-response conditions. Analyses of data from four cross-modal cuing experiments demonstrate an above-chance, intermediate link for visual cues, but no systematic relation for auditory cues. Thus, the link between spatial attention and direction of microsaccades depends on the experimental condition and time of occurrence, but it can be very strong.},

abstract = {Theories of choice response time (RT) provide insight into the psychological underpinnings of simple decisions. Evidence accumulation (or sequential sampling) models are the most successful theories of choice RT. These models all have the same "scaling" property--that a subset of their parameters can be multiplied by the same amount without changing their predictions. This property means that a single parameter must be fixed to allow the estimation of the remaining parameters. In the present article, we show that the traditional solution to this problem has overconstrained these models, unnecessarily restricting their ability to account for data and making implicit--and therefore unexamined--psychological assumptions. We show that versions of these models that address the scaling problem in a minimal way can provide a better description of data than can their overconstrained counterparts, even when increased model complexity is taken into account.},

variations in human cognitive processing as reflected by task-evoked
pupillary responses. The authors conclude with a few small suggestions
for future pupillometric studies and the role that they may play
in cognitive neuroscience more generally. Topics include: historical
background (large-scale pupillary movements in clinical neurology,
small-scale pupillary movements in cognitive psychophysiology, psychophysiological
reporter variables); physical context (pupillary anatomy, pupillary
movements, pupillary reflex dilations, pupillary pharmacology); and
inferential context: task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs) are
reporter variables (biometrics: measuring pupillary movements, psychometrics:
computing TEPRs, TEPRs as a general measure of processing load, TEPRs

abstract = {Rituals shape many aspects of our lives, and they are no less common in scientific research than elsewhere. One that figures prominently in hypothesis testing is the null ritual, the pitting of hypotheses against chance. Although known to be problematic, this practice is still widely used. One way to resist the lure of the null ritual is to increase the precision of theories by casting them as formal models. These can be tested against each other, instead of against chance, which in turn enables a researcher to decide between competing theories based on quantitative measures. This article gives an overview of the advantages of modeling, describes research that is based on it, outlines the difficulties associated with model testing, and summarizes some of the solutions for dealing with these difficulties. Pointers to resources for teaching modeling in university classes are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved). (from the journal abstract)},

Little is known concerning how measures of variability of the maximum or minimum change with n. Here, a new measure of random variability, the quantile spread, is introduced, which possesses sufficient strength to define distributional orderings and derive a number of results concerning variability of the maximum and the minimum statistics. The quantile spread ordering may be useful in many venues. Several interesting open problems are pointed out.},

This also presents new opportunities for understanding the role of informatics in scientific work practices, and for designing new kinds tools and resources needed to support them. These issues of data management, scientific communication and collective activity are brought together at once in scientific data collections (SDCs). What can the development and use of shared SDCs tell us about collective activity, dynamic infrastructures, and distributed scientific work? Using examples drawn from a nascent neuroscience data collection, we examine some unique features of SDCs to illustrate that they do more than act as infrastructures for scientific research. Instead, we argue that they are themselves instantiations of Distributed Collective Practice (DCP), and as such illustrate concepts of transition, emergence, and interdependency that may not be so apparent in other kinds of DCPs. We propose that research into SDCs can yield new insights into institutional arrangements, policymaking, and authority structures in other very large-scale socio-technical networks.},

abstract = {We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants read sentences, some of which contained an anomalous word. In the critical sentences (e.g., The meal was devouring...), the syntactic cues unambiguously signaled an Agent interpretation of the subject noun, whereas the semantic cues supported a Theme interpretation. An Agent interpretation would render the main verb semantically anomalous (as meals do not devour things). Conversely, the Theme interpretation would render the main verb syntactically anomalous (as the -ED form, not the -ING form, is syntactically appropriate for this interpretation). We report that the main verbs in such sentences elicit the P600 effect associated with syntactic anomalies, rather than the N400 effect associated with semantic anomalies. We conclude that, at least under certain conditions, semantic information is "in control" of how words are combined during sentence processing.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide the first national data on the nature, extent, and consequences of withholding among life science trainees. METHOD: In 2003, the authors surveyed 1,077 second-year doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in life sciences at 50 U.S. universities, with a comparison group of trainees in computer science and chemical engineering. The study variables examined trainees' exposure to and the consequences of data withholding. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six trainees (23.0\%) reported that they had asked for and been denied access to information, data, materials, or programming associated with published research and 221 (20.6\%) to unpublished research. Eighty-five trainees (7.9\%) reported that they had denied another academic scientist's request(s) related to their own published research. Five hundred thirty-three trainees (50.8\%) reported that withholding had had a negative effect on the progress of their research, 508 (48.5\%) on the rate of discovery in their lab/research group, 472 (45.0\%) on the quality of their relationships with academic scientists, 346 (33.0\%) on the quality of their education, and 299 (28.5\%) on the level of communication in their lab/research group. Trainees denied access to research were significantly more likely to report that data withholding had had a negative effect on several aspects of the educational experience. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding had demonstrated negative effects on trainees. The life sciences, more so than chemical engineering or computer science, will have to address this issue among its trainees. Failure to do so could result in delayed research, inefficient training, and a culture of withholding among future life scientists.},

abstract = {Recent event-related potential studies report a P600 effect to incongruous verbs preceded by semantically associated inanimate noun-phrase (NP) arguments, e.g., "eat" in "At breakfast the eggs would eat...". This P600 effect may reflect the processing cost incurred when semantic-thematic relationships between critical verbs and their preceding NP argument(s) bias towards different interpretations to those dictated by their sentences' syntactic structures. We have termed such violations of alternative thematic roles, 'thematic role violations.' Semantic-thematic relationships are influenced both by semantic associations and by more basic semantic features, such as a noun's animacy. This study determined whether a P600 effect can be evoked by verbs whose thematic structures are violated by their preceding inanimate NP arguments, even in the absence of close semantic-associative relationships with these arguments or their preceding contexts. ERPs were measured to verbs under four conditions: (1) non-violated ("At breakfast the boys would eat..."); (2) preceded by introductory clauses and animate NPs that violated their pragmatic expectations but not their thematic structures ("At breakfast the boys would plant..."); (3) preceded by semantically related contexts but inanimate NPs that violated their thematic structures ("At breakfast the eggs would eat..."); (4) preceded by semantically unrelated contexts and inanimate NPs that also violated their thematic structures ("At breakfast the eggs would plant..."). Pragmatically non-thematic role violated verbs preceded by unrelated contexts and animate NPs evoked robust N400 effects and small P600 effects. Thematically violated verbs preceded by inanimate argument NPs evoked robust P600 effects but no N400 effects, regardless of whether these inanimate arguments or their preceding contexts were semantically related or unrelated to these verbs. These findings suggest that semantic-thematic relations, related to animacy constraints on verbs' arguments, are computed online and can immediately impact verb processing within active, English sentences.},

When arguments of verbs appear at the point where a syntactic violation is detected, a centroparietal positivity occurs, peaking at 600 ms after the presentation of the stimulus (P600), as is consistent with other types of syntactic anomalies. However, nonarguments in similar sentences fail to elicit the same response. For example, the reflexive in "John's brothers like himself" is in an argument position and elicits the P600 when compared to its grammatical counterpart. The nonargument, participating in the same type of mismatch, "John's brothers like Bill and himself," does not elicit the same positivity. This provides evidence that there are two processes involved in parsing this binding construction, one syntactic and another as yet unidentified, perhaps involving meaning or pragmatics.},

abstract = {Multifarious psychological constructs are indexed by the mean latency difference (MLD), the within-subject difference between mean response latency on two tasks. Two associations consistently emerge in mean latency data. Firstly, across subjects, mean latencies on distinct tasks are positively correlated. This correlation arises from individual differences in general rates of information processing that are a shared influence on response latency in diverse tasks. Secondly, across tasks, the mean and variance of mean latency are positively correlated. Compared to a simple task, a complex task has both a larger average mean latency and a larger variance of mean latency, across subjects. Taken together, these associations make the interpretation of the MLD problematic by biasing correlations between the MLD and (a) task mean latencies, (b) the average of the mean latencies, (c) external criteria, and (d) other MLDs. A variety of mean latency transformations were evaluated and, while they differed in their effectiveness, they did not satisfactorily rectify MLD biases. An alternative approach, focusing on scale invariant contrasts of within-subject response latency distributions, is introduced in the conclusion.},

abstract = {Two story-telling experiments examine the process of choosing between pronouns and proper names in speaking. Such choices are traditionally attributed to speakers striving to make referring expressions maximally interpretable to addressees. The experiments revealed a novel effect: even when a pronoun would not be ambiguous, the presence of another character in the discourse decreased pronoun use and increased latencies to refer to the most prominent character in the discourse. In other words, speakers were more likely to call Minnie Minnie than shewhen Donald was also present. Even when the referent character appeared alone in the stimulus picture, the presence of another character in the preceding discourse reduced pronouns. Furthermore, pronoun use varied with features associated with the speaker's degree of focus on the preceding discourse (e.g., narrative style and disfluency). We attribute this effect to competition for attentional resources in the speaker's representation of the discourse.},

abstract = {Much is known about the anatomy of corticocortical connections, yet
little is known concerning their physiology. In order to have access
to the synaptic and temporal aspects of the activity elicited through
corticocortical connections, we developed an in vitro approach on
slices of rat visual cortex. We used extracellular recordings of
field potentials combined with electrical stimulation to localise
regions of areas 17 and 18a that are connected. We found that corticocortical
connections between areas 17 and 18a can be preserved in 500 microm
thick slices, with a focus of activity separated from the stimulating
electrode by 1.5 mm to more than 3 mm. The potentials elicited in
one area after stimulation of its neighbour displayed fast events,
corresponding to action potentials, and slow events, corresponding
to synaptic potentials. Intracellular recordings showed that the
earliest synaptic responses consisted of monosynaptic excitatory
potentials. Measurement of response latency showed that axons involved
in both feedforward and feedback corticocortical connections are
slowly conducting (0.3-0.8 m/s). Conduction velocity for antidromically
activated cells was not significantly different for the two sets
of connections. In an attempt to establish the spatial organisation
of functional synaptic inputs, field potential recordings were performed
in the different cortical layers and used to establish current source
density (CSD) graphs along the depth axis. The CSD maps obtained
were found to be somewhat variable from one case to another. It is
suggested that this variability results from the use of electrical
stimulation, which activates axons that are both afferent and efferent
to a given cortical area. The field potentials are therefore likely
to contain responses that correspond to the activity mediated by
the intrinsic collaterals mixed in variable amount with responses
produced by corticocortical synapses. With this restriction in mind,
it is suggested that, after stimulation of the supragranular layers,
the functional synaptic inputs of feedforward connections are concentrated
in layer 4 and the bottom of layer 3, while those of feedback axons
involve mainly the upper part of the supragranular layers. The intrinsic
collaterals of the neurones participating in corticocortical connections
seem also to provide the bulk of their inputs to the upper part of
the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of activity obtained
after infragranular layer stimulation was comparable to that obtained
after supragranular layer stimulation, except for the addition of
a supplementary region of activated synapses in the infragranular
layers.},

abstract = {Microsaccades are one component of the small eye movements that constitute
fixation. Their implementation in the oculomotor system is unknown.
To better understand the physiological and mechanistic processes
underlying microsaccade generation, we studied microsaccadic inhibition,
a transient drop of microsaccade rate, in response to irrelevant
visual and auditory stimuli. Quantitative descriptions of the time
course and strength of inhibition revealed a strong dependence of
microsaccadic inhibition on stimulus characteristics. In Experiment
1, microsaccadic inhibition occurred sooner after auditory than after
visual stimuli and after luminance-contrast than after color-contrast
visual stimuli. Moreover, microsaccade amplitude strongly decreased
during microsaccadic inhibition. In Experiment 2, the latency of
microsaccadic inhibition increased with decreasing luminance contrast.
We develop a conceptual model of microsaccade generation in which
microsaccades result from fixation-related activity in a motor map
coding for both fixation and saccades. In this map, fixation is represented
at the central site. Saccades are generated by activity in the periphery,
their amplitude increasing with eccentricity. The activity at the
central, fixation-related site of the map predicts the rate of microsaccades
as well as their amplitude and direction distributions. This model
represents a framework for understanding the dynamics of microsaccade
behavior in a broad range of tasks.},

In two experiments (visual versus auditory presentation) using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we addressed this question by presenting sentences in which the critical word simultaneously realized both a word category and a transitivity violation. ERPs for sentences with both types of violation clustered with the patterns for sentences with a word category violation only, but were different from the patterns elicited by argument structure violations in isolation, since only the latter elicited an N400 ERP component. The finding that an argument structure violation evoked an N400 only if the phrase structure of the respective sentence was correct suggests that a successful integration of the word category information of a verb functionally precedes the application of its argument structure information.},

We presented semantic reversal anomalies in syntactically correct and unambiguous sentences, like \{\#\}The cat that fled from the mice.... If participants would use a plausibility strategy and combine the lexical items in the most plausible way, they would--in the case of the example--assume that the mice were fleeing from the cat. Furthermore, this interpretation could lead them to expect a particular inflection of the verb (here: plural inflection). The violation of this expectation could have elicited the P600 effect. Such a syntactic mismatch can occur only in sentences in which the number of theme and agent are different. Therefore, in the present study, the number of theme and agent was either different or the same. A centroparietal P600 effect was present not only in different number sentences but also in same number sentences. Consequently, the P600 effect was not due to a syntactic mismatch, thereby challenging a purely syntactic account of the P600. An alternative view concerning the functional significance of the P600 is discussed, i.e., that it reflects a monitoring component that checks upon the veridicality of ones sentence perception.},

Many web-accessible resources have been created, ranging from simple data collections to highly structured databases. Although many challenges remain in adapting neuroscience to the new electronic forum envisioned by neuroinformatics proponents, these efforts have succeeded in formalizing the requirements for effective data sharing and data integration across multiple sources. In this perspective, we discuss the importance of spatial systems and ontologies for proper modeling of neuroscience data and their use in a large-scale data integration effort, the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN).},

abstract = {The 'visual world paradigm' typically involves presenting participants with a visual scene and recording eye movements as they either hear an instruction to manipulate objects in the scene or as they listen to a description of what may happen to those objects. In this study, participants heard each target sentence only after the corresponding visual scene had been displayed and then removed. For a scene depicting a man, a woman, a cake, and a newspaper, the eyes were subsequently directed, during 'eat' in 'the man will eat the cake', towards where the cake had previously been located even though the screen had been blank for over 2 s. The rapidity of these movements mirrored the anticipatory eye movements observed in previous studies [Cognition 73 (1999) 247; J. Mem. Lang. 49 (2003) 133]. Thus, anticipatory eye movements are not dependent on a concurrent visual scene, but are dependent on a mental record of the scene that is independent of whether the visual scene is still present.},

abstract = {An event-related brain potentials experiment was carried out to examine the interplay of referential and structural factors during sentence processing in discourse. Subjects read (Dutch) sentences beginning like David told the girl that... in short story contexts that had introduced either one or two referents for a critical singular noun phrase (the girl). The waveforms showed that within 280 ms after onset of the critical noun the reader had already determined whether the noun phrase had a unique referent in earlier discourse. Furthermore, this referential information was immediately used in parsing the rest of the sentence, which was briefly ambiguous between a complement clause (... that there would be some visitors) and a relative clause (... that had been on the phone to hang up). A consistent pattern of P600/SPS effects elicited by various subsequent disambiguations revealed that a two-referent discourse context had led the parser to initially pursue the relative-clause alternative to a larger extent than a one-referent context. Together, the results suggest that during the processing of sentences in discourse, structural and referential sources of information interact on a word-by-word basis.},

abstract = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

abstract = {Much work has demonstrated so-called attraction errors in the production of subjectverb agreement (e.g., The key to the cabinets are on the table, Bock, J. K., \& Miller, C. A. (1991). Broken agreement. Cognitive Psychology, 23, 4593), in which a verb erroneously agrees with an intervening noun. Six self-paced reading experiments examined the online mech- anisms underlying the analogous attraction effects that have been shown in comprehen- sion; namely reduced disruption for subjectverb agreement violations when these attractor nouns intervene. One class of theories suggests that these effects are rooted in faulty representation of the number of the subject, while another class of theories suggests instead that such effects arise in the process of re-accessing subject number at the verb. Two main findings provide evidence against the first class of theories. First, attraction also occurs in relative clause configurations in which the attractor noun does not intervene between subject and verb and is not in a direct structural relationship with the subject head (e.g., The drivers who the runner wave to each morning). Second, we observe a grammatical asymmetry: attraction effects are limited to ungrammatical sentences, which would be unexpected if the representation of subject number were inherently prone to error. Weargue that agreement attraction in comprehension instead reflects a cue-based retrieval mechanism that is subject to retrieval errors. The grammatical asymmetry can be accounted for under one implementation that we propose, or if the mechanism is only called upon when the predicted agreement features fail to be instantiated on the verb.},

In addition to storing GenePix (Axon Instruments) and ScanAlyze output from spotted microarrays, SMD has recently added the ability to store, retrieve, display and analyze the complete raw data produced by several additional microarray platforms and image analysis software packages, so that we can also now accept data from Affymetrix GeneChips (MAS5/GCOS or dChip), Agilent Catalog or Custom arrays (using Agilent's Feature Extraction software) or data created by SpotReader (Niles Scientific). We have implemented software that allows us to accept MAGE-ML documents from array manufacturers and to submit MIAME-compliant data in MAGE-ML format directly to ArrayExpress and GEO, greatly increasing the ease with which data from SMD can be published adhering to accepted standards and also increasing the accessibility of published microarray data to the general public. We have introduced a new tool to facilitate data sharing among our users, so that datasets can be shared during, before or after the completion of data analysis.

abstract = {The most powerful tests of response time (RT) models often involve the whole shape of the RT distribution, thus avoiding mimicking that can occur at the level of RT means and variances. Nonparametric distribution estimation is, in principle, the most appropriate approach, but such estimators are sometimes difficult to obtain. On the other hand, distribution fitting, given an algebraic function, is both easy and compact. We review the general approach to performing distribution fitting with maximum likelihood (ML) and a method based on quantiles (quantile maximum probability, QMP). We show that QMP has both small bias and good efficiency when used with common distribution functions (the ex-Gaussian, Gumbel, lognormal, Wald, and Weibull distributions). In addition, we review some software packages performing ML (PASTIS, QMPE, DISFIT, and MATHEMATICA) and compare their results. In general, the differences between packages have little influence on the optimal solution found, but the form of the distribution function has: Both the lognormal and the Wald distributions have non-linear dependencies between the parameter estimates that tend to increase the overall bias in parameter recovery and to decrease efficiency. We conclude by laying out a few pointers on how to relate descriptive models of RT to cognitive models of RT.

Given certain information relating to chosen distribution functions, one can estimate the parameters of these distributions and of finite mixtures of these distributions. In addition, left and/or right censoring or truncation may be imposed. Censoring and truncation are useful methods by which to accommodate outlying observations, which are a pervasive problem in RT research. We consider five RT distributions: the Weibull, the ex-Gaussian, the gamma, the log-normal, and the Wald. We employ quasi-Newton optimization to obtain ML estimates. Multicase distributional analyses can be carried out, which enable one to conduct detailed (across or within subjects) comparisons of RT data by means of loglikelihood difference tests. Parameters may be freely estimated, estimated subject to boundary constraints, constrained to be equal (within or over cases), or fixed.

Wesearched six journals that have explicit policies requiring thesubmission of DNA sequences (Table 1). The previous sixmonths (through February, 2006) of issues or most recent 30papers presenting DNA sequence data were sought, thoughwe examined a year of issues of one journal to test a longertermtrend (see below). Studies presenting only confi rmatorysequence or sequences that would not be found in nature(e.g., transgenes) were not counted. We searched forGenBank entries using locus and species names, authors ofthe article, etc., thus executing a search that would mimic anyscientist's approach.No journal had complete compliance with its requirementfor all DNA sequences to have been submitted to GenBank Between 3\% and 20\% of papers in these journalsdid not include GenBank accession numbers, and between3\% and 15\% of studies never submitted their DNA sequencesat all. We also identifi ed several papers with errors in thesupplied accession numbers, but these errors were notcounted. Table 1 also notes ``special cases'' that we consideredless egregious violations of the journal rules. In these cases,the DNA sequences were noted in the paper itself, either assupplementary materials or by noting identity to publishedsequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:A fundamental goal of the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) "Roadmap" is to strengthen Translational Research, defined as the movement of discoveries in basic research to application at the clinical level. A significant barrier to translational research is the lack of uniformly structured data across related biomedical domains. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web that enables navigation and meaningful use of digital resources by automatic processes. It is based on common formats that support aggregation and integration of data drawn from diverse sources. A variety of technologies have been built on this foundation that, together, support identifying, representing, and reasoning across a wide range of biomedical data. The Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG), set up within the framework of the World Wide Web Consortium, was launched to explore the application of these technologies in a variety of areas. Subgroups focus on making biomedical data available in RDF, working with biomedical ontologies, prototyping clinical decision support systems, working on drug safety and efficacy communication, and supporting disease researchers navigating and annotating the large amount of potentially relevant literature.RESULTS:We present a scenario that shows the value of the information environment the Semantic Web can support for aiding neuroscience researchers. We then report on several projects by members of the HCLSIG, in the process illustrating the range of Semantic Web technologies that have applications in areas of biomedicine.CONCLUSION:Semantic Web technologies present both promise and challenges. Current tools and standards are already adequate to implement components of the bench-to-bedside vision. On the other hand, these technologies are young. Gaps in standards and implementations still exist and adoption is limited by typical problems with early technology, such as the need for a critical mass of practitioners and installed base, and growing pains as the technology is scaled up. Still, the potential of interoperable knowledge sources for biomedicine, at the scale of the World Wide Web, merits continued work.},

abstract = {This study investigates brain responses to violations of information structure in wh-question-answer pairs, with particular emphasis on violations of focus assignment in it-clefts (It was the queen that silenced the banker). Two types of ERP responses in answers to wh-questions were found. First, all words in the focus-marking (cleft) position elicited a large positivity (P3b) characteristic of sentence-final constituents, as did the final words of these sentences, which suggests that focused elements may trigger integration effects like those seen at sentence end. Second, the focusing of an inappropriate referent elicited a smaller, N400-like effect. The results show that comprehenders actively use structural focus cues and discourse-level restrictions during online sentence processing. These results, based on visual stimuli, were different from the brain response to auditory focus violations indicated by pitch-accent [Hruska, C., Steinhauer, K., Alter, K., \& Steube, A. (2000).

abstract = {Three reading-time experiments in Chinese are reported that test contrasting views of how pronominal coreference is achieved. On the one hand, studies of reading time and eye tracking suggest that reduced expressions, such as the pronoun he, serve as critical links to integrate separate utterances into a coherent model of discourse. On the other hand, probe-word recognition studies indicate that full anaphoric expressions, such as a repeated name, are more readily interpreted than reduced expressions due to their rich lexical information, which provides effective cues to match the representation of the appropriate referent in memory. The results indicate that the ease of integrating the critical referent into a model of discourse is a function of the congruence of lexical, semantic, and discourse features conveyed by a syntactically prominent reduced expression within linguistic input. This pattern supports the view that a reduced expression is interpreted on-line and indeed plays a critical role in promoting discourse coherence by facilitating the semantic integration of separate utterances.},

abstract = {With the rapid progress of biological research, great demands are proposed for integrative knowledge-sharing systems to efficiently support collaboration of biological researchers from various fields. To fulfill such requirements, we have developed a data-centric knowledge-sharing platform WebLab for biologists to fetch, analyze, manipulate and share data under an intuitive web interface. Dedicated space is provided for users to store their input data and analysis results. Users can upload local data or fetch public data from remote databases, and then perform analysis using more than 260 integrated bioinformatic tools. These tools can be further organized as customized analysis workflows to accomplish complex tasks automatically. In addition to conventional biological data, WebLab also provides rich supports for scientific literatures, such as searching against full text of uploaded literatures and exporting citations into various well-known citation managers such as EndNote and BibTex. To facilitate team work among colleagues, WebLab provides a powerful and flexible sharing mechanism, which allows users to share input data, analysis results, scientific literatures and customized workflows to specified users or groups with sophisticated privilege settings. WebLab is publicly available at http://weblab.cbi.pku.edu.cn, with all source code released as Free Software.},

abstract = {Understanding how response time (RT) changes with manipulations has been critical in distinguishing among theories in cognition. It is well known that aggregating data distorts functional relationships (e.g., Estes, 1956). Less well appreciated is a second pitfall: Minimizing squared errors (i.e., OLS regression) also distorts estimated functional forms with RT data. We discuss three properties of RT that should be modeled for accurate analysis and, on the basis of these three properties, provide a hierarchical Weibull regression model for regressing RT onto covariates. Hierarchical regression model analysis of lexical decision task data reveals that RT decreases as a power function of word frequency with the scale of RT decreasing 11\% for every doubling of word frequency. A detailed discussion of the model and analysis techniques are presented as archived materials and may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive.},

- wmc multicomponent system for maintaining information in the face of ongoing processing and/or distraction
- clear distinction between stmc and wmc (stmc domain-specific, wmc domain-general)
- no distinction between verbal and other wmc
- wmc measures created to include not only rehearsal, but also a simultaneous processing component (reading, counting, operating, symmetry judging, etc.)
- later true/false for sentences > avoided strategy that supported focusing only on the recall component
- later not increasing, but randomized order of set sizes
- processing does not have to be reading

        
recommendations for administration
- immediate and vigilant stimulus presentation (delay might permit rehearsal, turning the wmc task into a stmc task)
- individual administration (distraction in groups, etc.)
- sufficient item size (at least 5, otherwise ceiling effects likely)

        
scoring
- correlational evidence from studies on adults supports the common practice to not consider processing performance in the wmc span score
- performance on processing usually positively correlated with recall
- no evidence for processing-storage-tradeoff
- absolute scores (d\{\&\}c) problematic, because difficulty of span set might vary on many dimensions (sentence length, operation difficulty, etc.)
> absolute span scores inadequate
- instead: correct and incorrect numerically coded, no distinction between error types
- credit when processing wrong? > yes
- full or partial credit for imperfect recall?
- different weight for longer sets?
> equally: score proportion of each set and then overall proportion (1/2 the same as 3/6)
> pcu, pcl, anl, anu
- partial-credit clear advantage in terms of internal consistency, within these unit-weighted scores better

        
- wmc tests reliable (cronbach's alpha, split/half consistency, etc.)

        
- all tasks show strong validity, predict performance on broad array of measures that involve attention and/or memory
- show discriminant validity insofar as they do not predict performance on relatively automatic tasks (prosaccade)

        
wmc vs. other tasks
- stm no unique variance in general cog. ability, when wmc partialled out, but correlation between those to weak to conclude, that they represent the same construct
- to most effectively measure wmc, task must contain processing component
- not clear, if processing has to be unrelated to storage

        
optimal research strategy: several wmc measures plus latent variable analysis
- con: multiple measures and large samples needed

        
extreme-group designs:
- categorizing continuous variable problematic, because 1) information and power are lost, 2) subjects who are not equal are treated as if they were, 3) misclassification can occur
- especially true, when magnitude of relationship between wmc and other measure is in question
- good to check, whether or not a relationship is there or not
- then: upper and lower quartile
- do not use median splits: 1) no reason to categorize, when entire sample has been sampled, 2) misclassification is more likely than with quartiles

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Collaboration among investigators has become critical to scientific research. This includes ad hoc collaboration established through personal contacts as well as formal consortia established by funding agencies. Continued growth in online resources for scientific research and communication has promoted the development of highly networked research communities. Extending these networks globally requires identifying additional investigators in a given domain, profiling their research interests, and collecting current contact information. We present a novel strategy for building investigator networks dynamically and producing detailed investigator profiles using data available in PubMed abstracts. RESULTS: We developed a novel strategy to obtain detailed investigator information by automatically parsing the affiliation string in PubMed records. We illustrated the results by using a published literature database in human genome epidemiology (HuGE Pub Lit) as a test case. Our parsing strategy extracted country information from 92.1\% of the affiliation strings in a random sample of PubMed records and in 97.0\% of HuGE records, with accuracies of 94.0\% and 91.0\%, respectively. Institution information was parsed from 91.3\% of the general PubMed records (accuracy 86.8\%) and from 94.2\% of HuGE PubMed records (accuracy 87.0). We demonstrated the application of our approach to dynamic creation of investigator networks by creating a prototype information system containing a large database of PubMed abstracts relevant to human genome epidemiology (HuGE Pub Lit), indexed using PubMed medical subject headings converted to Unified Medical Language System concepts. Our method was able to identify 70-90\% of the investigators/collaborators in three different human genetics fields; it also successfully identified 9 of 10 genetics investigators within the PREBIC network, an existing preterm birth research network. CONCLUSION: We successfully created a web-based prototype capable of creating domain-specific investigator networks based on an application that accurately generates detailed investigator profiles from PubMed abstracts combined with robust standard vocabularies. This approach could be used for other biomedical fields to efficiently establish domain-specific investigator networks.},

Models of parsing have explained this tendency by appealing either to a race in the construction of alternative structures or to reanalysis. However, it is also possible that readers of ambiguous sentences save time by strategically underspecifying interpretations of ambiguous attachments. In a self-paced reading study, participants viewed sentences with relative clauses that could attach to one of two sites. Type of question was also manipulated between participants in order to test whether goals can influence reading/parsing strategies. The experiment revealed an ambiguity advantage in reading times, but only when participants expected superficial comprehension questions. When participants expected queries about relative clause interpretation, disambiguating regions were inspected with more care, and the ambiguity advantage was attenuated. However, even when participants expected relative clause queries, question-answering times suggested underspecified representations of ambiguous relative clause attachments. The results support the construal and "good-enough" models of parsing.},

abstract = {A Bayesian system identification technique was used to determine which image characteristics predict where people fixate when viewing natural images. More specifically an estimate was derived for the mapping between image characteristics at a given location and the probability that this location was fixated. Using a large database of eye fixations to natural images, we determined the most probable (a posteriori) model of this mapping. From a set of candidate feature maps consisting of edge, contrast and luminance maps (at two different spatial scales), fixation probability was dominated by high spatial frequency edge information. The best model applied compressive non-linearity to the high frequency edge detecting filters (approximately a square root). Both low spatial frequency edges and contrast had weaker, but inhibitory, effects. The contributions of the other maps were so small as to be behaviourally irrelevant. This Bayesian method identifies not only the relevant weighting of the different maps, but how this weighting varies as a function of distance from the point of fixation. It was found that rather than centre surround inhibition, the weightings simply averaged over an area of about 2 degrees.},

We show that several classic sources of evidence for time-based forgetting can be re-interpreted in terms of an interference-based view, and that new experiments provide compelling evidence against decay. We conclude that progress requires moving beyond demonstrations of qualitative effects and focusing instead on testing quantitative predictions of models.},

abstract = {It is well known that sentences containing object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error) are more difficult to comprehend than sentences containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading.},

abstract = {In 1980, the N400 event-related potential was described in association with semantic anomalies within sentences. When, in 1992, a second waveform, the P600, was reported in association with syntactic anomalies and ambiguities, the story appeared to be complete: the brain respected a distinction between semantic and syntactic representation and processes. Subsequent studies showed that the P600 to syntactic anomalies and ambiguities was modulated by lexical and discourse factors. Most surprisingly, more than a decade after the P600 was first described, a series of studies reported that semantic verb-argument violations, in the absence of any violations or ambiguities of syntax can evoke robust P600 effects and no N400 effects. These observations have raised fundamental questions about the relationship between semantic and syntactic processing in the brain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent studies that have demonstrated P600s to semantic violations in light of several proposed triggers: semantic-thematic attraction, semantic associative relationships, animacy and semantic-thematic violations, plausibility, task, and context. I then discuss these findings in relation to a unifying theory that attempts to bring some of these factors together and to link the P600 produced by semantic verb-argument violations with the P600 evoked by unambiguous syntactic violations and syntactic ambiguities. I suggest that normal language comprehension proceeds along at least two competing neural processing streams: a semantic memory-based mechanism, and a combinatorial mechanism (or mechanisms) that assigns structure to a sentence primarily on the basis of morphosyntactic rules, but also on the basis of certain semantic-thematic constraints. I suggest that conflicts between the different representations that are output by these distinct but interactive streams lead to a continued combinatorial analysis that is reflected by the P600 effect. I discuss some of the implications of this non-syntactocentric, dynamic model of language processing for understanding individual differences, language processing disorders and the neuroanatomical circuitry engaged during language comprehension. Finally, I suggest that that these two processing streams may generalize beyond the language system to real-world visual event comprehension.},

This chapter develops a theory of reanalysis called limited repair parsing.
Repair parsers deal with the problem of local ambiguity in part by modifying
previously built structure when the chosen structure later prove s to be
inconsistent. This modification of existing structure distinguishes repair
parsing from parallel or multi-path parsing, least-commitment parsing,
backtracking, or reparsing strategies. Parsers with a limited capability for
repair are psycholinguistically important because they can potentially
explain the contrasts between difficult garden path structures (when repair
fails) and unproblematic local ambiguities (when repair is successful or
easy). Although the idea of repair has been implicit in some psycholinguistic
work (and emerged explicitly in the diagnosis model of Fodor \& Inoue, 1994, and
the NL-Soar model of Lewis, 1993), there has been no clear formulation of the
general class of repair parsers. This chapter makes a first step toward such a
formulation, shows how repair parsing offers significant computational
advantages over other alternatives for reanalysis, and proposes a particular
repair mechanism, snip , that explains a wide range of cross-linguistic
reanalysis phenomena. Snip is a proposal for a simple, automatic, on-line
repair process. The chapter concludes by briefly describing how snip can be
embedded in a more comprehensive sentence processing architecture that maintains
the structural sensitivity of purely syntactic theories like Pritchett's (1992),
yet still accounts for the flexibility of parsing as revealed by interactive
studies},

abstract = {Syntactic priming during language production is pervasive and well-studied. Hearing, reading, speaking or writing a sentence with a given structure increases the probability of subsequently producing the same structure, regardless of whether the prime and target share lexical content. In contrast, syntactic priming during comprehension has proven more elusive, fueling claims that comprehension is less dependent on general syntactic representations and more dependent on lexical knowledge. In three experiments we explored syntactic priming during spoken language comprehension. Participants acted out double-object (DO) or prepositional-object (PO) dative sentences while their eye movements were recorded. Prime sentences used different verbs and nouns than the target sentences. In target sentences, the onset of the direct-object noun was consistent with both an animate recipient and an inanimate theme, creating a temporary ambiguity in the argument structure of the verb (DO e.g., Show the horse the book; PO e.g., Show the horn to the dog). We measured the difference in looks to the potential recipient and the potential theme during the ambiguous interval. In all experiments, participants who heard DO primes showed a greater preference for the recipient over the theme than those who heard PO primes, demonstrating across-verb priming during online language comprehension. These results accord with priming found in production studies, indicating a role for abstract structural information during comprehension as well as production.},

Through comprehensive, integrative genomic analysis of all available human disease characterizations we gain crucial insight into the molecular phenomena underlying pathogenesis as well as intra- and inter-disease differentiation. Such knowledge is crucial in the development of improved clinical diagnostics and the identification of molecular targets for novel therapeutics. In this study we build on our previous work to realize the next important step in large-scale translational discovery and analysis, which is to automatically identify those genomic experiments in which a disease state is compared to a normal control state. We present an automated text mining method that employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify disease-related experiments in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) that include measurements for both disease and normal control states. In this manner, we find that 62\% of disease-related experiments contain sample subsets that can be automatically identified as normal controls. Furthermore, we calculate that the identified experiments characterize diseases that contribute to 30\% of all human disease-related mortality in the United States. This work demonstrates that we now have the necessary tools and methods to initiate large-scale translational bioinformatics inquiry across the broad spectrum of high-impact human disease.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinical researchers need to share data to support scientific validation and information reuse and to comply with a host of regulations and directives from funders. Various organizations are constructing informatics resources in the form of centralized databases to ensure reuse of data derived from sponsored research. The widespread use of such open databases is contingent on the protection of patient privacy. METHODS: We review privacy-related problems associated with data sharing for clinical research from technical and policy perspectives. We investigate existing policies for secondary data sharing and privacy requirements in the context of data derived from research and clinical settings. In particular, we focus on policies specified by the US National Institutes of Health and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and touch on how these policies are related to current and future use of data stored in public database archives. We address aspects of data privacy and identifiability from a technical, although approachable, perspective and summarize how biomedical databanks can be exploited and seemingly anonymous records can be reidentified using various resources without hacking into secure computer systems. RESULTS: We highlight which clinical and translational data features, specified in emerging research models, are potentially vulnerable or exploitable. In the process, we recount a recent privacy-related concern associated with the publication of aggregate statistics from pooled genome-wide association studies that have had a significant impact on the data sharing policies of National Institutes of Health-sponsored databanks. CONCLUSION: Based on our analysis and observations we provide a list of recommendations that cover various technical, legal, and policy mechanisms that open clinical databases can adopt to strengthen data privacy protection as they move toward wider deployment and adoption.},

These scientific and technological collaborations are part of a general trend toward more fluid, flexible, and temporary organizational arrangements, but they have received very limited scholarly attention. <i>Structures of Scientific Collaboration</i> is the first study to examine multi-organizational collaboration systematically, drawing on a database of fifty-three collaborations documented for the Center for History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics. By integrating quantitative sociological analyses with detailed case histories, Shrum, Genuth, and Chompalov pioneer a new and truly interdisciplinary method for the study of science and technology.<br /> <br /> Scientists undertake multi-organizational collaborations because individual institutions often lack sufficient resources--including the latest technology--to achieve a given research objective. The authors find that collaborative research depends on both technology and bureaucracy; scientists claim to abhor bureaucracy, but most collaborations use it constructively to achieve their goals. The book analyzes the structural elements of collaboration (among them formation, size and duration, organization, technological practices, and participant experiences) and the relationships among them. The authors find that trust, though viewed as positive, is not necessarily associated with successful projects; indeed, the formal structures of bureaucracy reduce the need for high levels of trust--and make possible the independence so valued by participating scientists.},

abstract = {We describe a hierarchical model of invariant visual pattern recognition
in the visual cortex. In this model, the knowledge of how patterns
change when objects move is learned and encapsulated in terms of
high probability sequences at each level of the hierarchy. Configuration
of object parts is captured by the patterns of coincident high probability
sequences. This knowledge is then encoded in a highly efficient Bayesian
network structure. The learning algorithm uses a temporal stability
criterion to discover object concepts and movement patterns. We show
that the architecture and algorithms are biologically plausible.
The large scale architecture of the system matches the large scale
organization of the cortex and the micro-circuits derived from the
local computations match the anatomical data on cortical circuits.
The system exhibits invariance across a wide variety of transformations
and is robust in the presence of noise. Moreover, the model also
offers alternative explanations for various known cortical phenomena.},

annote = {- "The implicit causality associated with questioned makes it likely that the continuation will refer to Roy. If the processor rapidly becomes sensitive to this constraint (as may be the case with constraints in parsing: e.g., MacDonald, Pearlmutter, \{\&\} Seidenberg, 1994; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, \{\&\} Garnsey, 1994), then it might use this information to focus its attention on the likely cause. It would then be likely to assume that the antecedent of he is Roy in (1a) soon after encountering the pronoun. Following Garnham et al. (1996), we call this the Focusing account of the implicit causality bias." (424)- "Alternatively, implicit causality information might only affect later stages of processing, during or after the process of assigning the explicit cause, and at the point when the interpretations of the two clauses are integrated into a single interpretation for the sentence as a whole. If so, implicit causality information would not affect initial processing of the pronoun he in (1a). (The pronoun might be assigned an antecedent by some other strategy or not be assigned an antecedent at all at this point.) Again following Garnham et al. (1996), we call this the Integration account." (424)- "A final possibility is that implicit causality influences processing associated with both focusing and integration: We call this the Mixed account. The main goal of this paper is to determine which account is correct." (424)- Experiment McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinney (1995): Switchkosten zu hoch, wenn Probewort unangek\{\"{u}\}ndigt im Satz auftaucht? Ist Methode sensibel genug? Exetracking notwendig? (424)- Bei NP1-gebiasten Verben werden NP1 immer schneller verarbeitet, aber first-mention advantage \{\"{u}\}blich in probe task. (424)- NP1 bei NP2-gebiasten Verben schneller 100ms nach zweitem Namen und 200ms nach Pronomen, NP2 aber \{\"{a}\}hnlich schnell direkt nach Pronomen und an Satzende. McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinney: Informationen zu impliziter Kausalit\{\"{a}\}t beeinflusst Pronomenaufl\{\"{o}\}sung, Ergebnisse sprechen f\{\"{u}\}r focus account. (424)- Greene \{\&\} McKoon (1995): Dreisatzpassagen nach Muster (1)--(3). Probe nach zweitem Satz und direkt vor Pronomen in drittem Satz. F\{\"{u}\}r NP2-gebiaste Verben Interaktion: kleinere RT Probe nach Verb vs. Probe vor Verb deutlicher f\{\"{u}\}r NP2-Probes als f\{\"{u}\}r NP1-Probes. "This can be interpreted as indicating that NP2 biasing verbs immediately focus attention on NP2. But there is an alternative explanation: The NP2 probe occurs fairly soon after the NP2 name at the second probe position, unlike the first probe position. Participants may simply be responding faster to a fairly recent probe." (424)- Garnham et al. (1996): Drei Experimente mit zwei NPen gleichen Genders, first-mention advantage an allen Probepunkten und Kongruenzeffekt, keine Effekte. Fehlen eines Effekts widerspricht Ergebnissen von McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinney. Kongruenzeffekt unterst\{\"{u}\}tzt Integration Account. Fehlen eines satzfinalen Effekts schw\{\"{a}\}cht die Resultate. Probleme mit Methode? (425)- Viertes Experiment von Garnham et al. f\{\"{u}\}hrt Gender und Plausabilit\{\"{a}\}t als disambiguierende Faktoren ein. Kein Kongruenzeffekt, aber auch keine Unters\{\"{u}\}tzung f\{\"{u}\}r Focus account. (425)- Erkl\{\"{a}\}rung f\{\"{u}\}r Unterschiede: Multimodalit\{\"{a}\}t bei Garnham et al. k\{\"{o}\}nnte Performanz insgesamt gesenkt haben, so dass fr\{\"{u}\}he Einfl\{\"{u}\}sse ausgeglichen wurden. Andere Erkl\{\"{a}\}rungsm\{\"{o}\}glichkeit ist McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinneys Experimentdesign. "Most experiments on implicit causality, including those of Garnham et al. (1996), have employed a crossed design that includes both NP1- and NP2-biasing verbs, together with explicit causes disambiguated to NP1 or NP2. Hence there are two congruent and two incongruent conditions. In contrast, McDonald and MacWhinney's studies contained only congruent conditions." (425)- Au (1986): ProbandInnen sensibel f\{\"{u}\}r Bias zu Impliziter Kausalit\{\"{a}\}t bei Kategorisierung von Verben, k\{\"{o}\}nnten diese Information strategisch zur Vorhersage der expliziten Kausalit\{\"{a}\}t nutzen, wenn sie sie bereits bei der Verarbeitung extrahieren. (425)- McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinney argumentieren, sie f\{\"{a}\}nden keine Effekte impliziter Kausalit\{\"{a}\}t in S\{\"{a}\}tzen wie (4), so dass die Anaphernaufl\{\"{o}\}sung allein f\{\"{u}\}r ihre Effekte verantwortlich ist. Argument ist jedoch schwach, da verbindendes \_because\_ fehlt, was, wie Ehrlich (1980) gezeigt hat, f\{\"{u}\}r einen Einfluss impliziter Kausalit\{\"{o}\}t notwendig ist. (425)- Probe Task sehr k\{\"{u}\}nstliches Setting und unter Umst\{\"{a}\}nden nicht feink\{\"{o}\}rnig genug. Probetask zeigte keine Beg\{\"{u}\}nstigung unmittelbar nach Pronomen, Eyetracking aber belegt unmittelbare Interpretation von Pronomen. Ebenso suggeriert Probetask, dass zwei S\{\"{a}\}tze erst inegriert werden, nachdem zweiter Satz vollst\{\"{a}\}ndig verarbeitet ist. Traxler, Bybee \{\&\} Pickering (1997) belegen mittels Eyetracking, dass Integration bereits bei Verarbeitung des zweiten Satzes erfolgt. Die Daten, aufgrund derer f\{\"{u}\}r Focus oder Integration Account argumentier wird, sind also nicht zuverl\{\"{a}\}ssig. Lesezeiten scheinen aufschlussreicher. (425f.)- Hier also: self-paced reading, freie Variablen: Informationen zu implicit cause (verb bias) und explicit cause (beide gleich: cong, nicht: inc.), Anapher Name (unambig) oder Pronomen (ambig) (426)- Volle Nominamphrasen oder Namen k\{\"{o}\}nnen auf Antezedenten referieren, die sich au\{\ss\}erhalb des Fokus befinden, Pronomen referieren immer auf Fokus. "Hence pronouns are more sensitive indicators of states of focus than name or full noun phrase anaphors." Hudson et al. (1986): pronominale Referenzen werden schneller aufgel\{\"{o}\}st, wenn sie auf fokussierte Referenten verweisen, bei Namen liegt dieses Muster nicht vor. Sanford et al. (1988) finden \{\"{a}\}hnliches Muster. (426f.)- Die meisten Probetasks verwenden Namen als Probes, so dass Fokusunterschiede nicht zur Geltung kommen. (427)- "Hence the Focusing model predicts the causality congruency effect with pronouns but not with names. In other words, it predicts an interaction between congruency and anaphor type. In contrast, no such difference is predicted by the Integration account. As the mixed model allows for an influence of implicit causality during both the stages of focusing and integration, it predicts a congruency effect for both types of anaphor, but a reduced effect when repeated names are used." (427)- Weil Pronomen ambig waren, sollte Prozessor laut Focus Account den Antezedenten nur aufgrund des verb bias bestimmen. Bei inkongruenten S\{\"{a}\}tzen sollten daher Schwierigkeiten entstehen. Bei unambigen Namen sollten keine Schwierigkeiten auftreten. (427)- Vier Experimente: (1) ganze S\{\"{a}\}tze, (2) Pr\{\"{a}\}sentation wie bei McDonald \{\&\} MacWhinney in zwei Teilen, (3) variierende Verarbeitungstiefe durch variierende Fragen (Integrationseffekte sollten durch Tiefe beeinflusst werden, Fokuseffekte nicht) und (4) ambige und unambige Pronomen (wenn Kongruenzeffekt nur von Fokus kommt, sollte f\{\"{u}\}r ambige Pronomen ein st\{\"{a}\}rkerer Kongruenzeffekt auftreten als f\{\"{u}\}r unambige. (427)Experiment 1- 48 Targets, 96 Filler, 24 Verben (12x NP1-biased, 12x NP2-biased) je zweimal verwendet, vier Varianten jedes Items (kongruent vs. inkongruent, Pronomen vs. Name), Implicit Cause zwischen Items variiert. (427)- Bei Wiederholung von Verben werden Namen ge\{\"{a}\}ndert, so dass nur Verb und \_because\_ gleich bleiben. 8427)- Verst\{\"{a}\}ndnisfragen zu jedem Verb, bin\{\"{a}\}re Entscheidung "Ja" "Nein" (427)- Verbbias-Vortest (Satzerg\{\"{a}\}nzung) und Plausibilit\{\"{a}\}ts-Vortest (alle plausibel, jedoch Unterscheid zwischen kongruenten und inkongruenten Versionen).- Instruktion > Druck > ganzer Satz > Druck > Frage- ANOVA (Anapher × Implicit Cause × Kongruenz): Haupteffekt Kongruenz (LT cong. Weitere Evidenz gegen Focus und Mixed Account. (438)Diskussion - In Experimenten 1--3 Kongruenzeffekt bei Namen-Anaphern, ist kontr\{\"{a}\}r zu Vorhersagen von Focus Account. (438)- Experiment 4 zeigt Kongruenzeffekt, der unbeeinflusst von der Ambiguit\{\"{a}\}t des Pronomens auftritt.- "In conclusion, our results suggest that implicit causality information is employed by the language processor during integration. Implicit causality does not focus the processor on the potential referent consistent with the direction of the implicit causality bias. Rather, it facilitates the process of combining clauses to produce a coherent semantic representation." (438)},

abstract = {Younger and older adults read a series of expository and narrative
passages twice in order to answer comprehension questions. Reading
time was used to index attentional allocation to word, textbase,
and situation model processing and to assess shifts in the allocation
policy from the first to the second reading. Older readers' comprehension
was at least as good as that of younger readers. Analysis of reading
times suggested that for both genres, older adults allocated more
attention to situation model features than younger adults did on
the first reading, whereas young and old allocated attention similarly
to this level of representation on the second reading, suggesting
that mature readers may give greater priority to situation model
construction when first encountering text. Also, for both genres,
older adults showed relatively less facilitation than the young in
word-level processing in rereading, suggesting that representation
at this level is not as firmly established during reading or decays
more quickly for older readers. For narrative texts only, this pattern
also obtained for textbase processing. Collectively, these data show
that age equivalence in text comprehension at the molar level may
be accomplished through different processing routes at the molecular
level.},

abstract = {This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow \& Clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

Limitations of the Monte Carlo results are discussed and guidance provided for the practical application of the new technique.

We present the first mathematical model for the saccadic range error; this model makes explicit assumptions regarding underlying visual and oculomotor processes.

machine translation systems. The first step of the method is to parse
the source language string that is being translated. The second step
is to apply a series of transformations to the parse tree, effectively
reordering the surface string on the source language side of the
translation system. The goal of this step is to recover an underlying
word order that is closer to the target language word-order than
the original string. The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing
step in both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statistical
MT system. We describe experiments on translation from German to
English, showing an improvement from 25.2\% Bleu score for a baseline
system to 26.8\% Bleu score for the system with reordering, a statistically
significant improvement.},

abstract = {Many initiatives encourage research investigators to share their raw research datasets in hopes of increasing research efficiency and quality. Despite these investments of time and money, we do not have a firm grasp on the prevalence or patterns of data sharing and reuse. Previous survey methods for understanding data sharing patterns provide insight into investigator attitudes, but do not facilitate direct measurement of data sharing behaviour or its correlates. In this study, we evaluate and use bibliometric methods to understand the impact, prevalence, and patterns with which investigators publicly share their raw gene expression microarray datasets after study publication. To begin, we analyzed the citation history of 85 clinical trials published between 1999 and 2003. Almost half of the trials had shared their microarray data publicly on the internet. Publicly available data was significantly (p=0.006) associated with a 69\% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin. Digging deeper into data sharing patterns required methods for automatically identifying data creation and data sharing. We derived a full-text query to identify studies that generated gene expression microarray data. Issuing the query in PubMed Central, Highwire Press, and Google Scholar found 56\% of the data-creation studies in our gold standard, with 90\% precision. Next, we established that searching ArrayExpress and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases for PubMed article identifiers retrieved 77\% of associated publicly-accessible datasets. We used these methods to identify 11603 publications that created gene expression microarray data. Authors of at least 25\% of these publications deposited their data in the predominant public databases. We collected a wide set of variables about these studies and derived 15 factors that describe their authorship, funding, institution, publication, and domain environments. In second-order analysis, authors with a history of sharing and reusing shared gene expression microarray data were most likely to share their data, and those studying human subjects and cancer were least likely to share. We hope these methods and results will contribute to a deeper understanding of data sharing behavior and eventually more effective data sharing initiatives},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sharing of epidemiological and clinical data sets among researchers is poor at best, in detriment of science and community at large. The purpose of this paper is therefore to (1) describe a novel Web application designed to share information on study data sets focusing on epidemiological clinical research in a collaborative environment and (2) create a policy model placing this collaborative environment into the current scientific social context. METHODOLOGY: The Database of Databases application was developed based on feedback from epidemiologists and clinical researchers requiring a Web-based platform that would allow for sharing of information about epidemiological and clinical study data sets in a collaborative environment. This platform should ensure that researchers can modify the information. A Model-based predictions of number of publications and funding resulting from combinations of different policy implementation strategies (for metadata and data sharing) were generated using System Dynamics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The application allows researchers to easily upload information about clinical study data sets, which is searchable and modifiable by other users in a wiki environment. All modifications are filtered by the database principal investigator in order to maintain quality control. The application has been extensively tested and currently contains 130 clinical study data sets from the United States, Australia, China and Singapore. Model results indicated that any policy implementation would be better than the current strategy, that metadata sharing is better than data-sharing, and that combined policies achieve the best results in terms of publications. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our empirical observations and resulting model, the social network environment surrounding the application can assist epidemiologists and clinical researchers contribute and search for metadata in a collaborative environment, thus potentially facilitating collaboration efforts among research communities distributed around the globe.},

abstract = {Two eye movement experiments examined effects on syntactic reanalysis when the correct analysis was briefly entertained at an earlier point in the sentence. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences containing a noun phrase coordination/clausal coordination ambiguity, while in Experiment 2 they read sentences containing a subordinate clause object/main clause subject ambiguity. The critical conditions were designed to induce readers to construct the ultimately correct analysis just prior to being garden-pathed by the incorrect analysis. In both experiments, the earliest measures of the garden path effect were not modulated by this manipulation. However, there was significantly less regressive re-reading of the sentence in those conditions in which the correct analysis was likely to have been constructed, then abandoned, at an earlier point. These results suggest that a syntactic analysis that is abandoned in the course of processing a sentence is not lost altogether, and can be re-activated or retrieved from memory. Implications for models of initial syntactic analysis and reanalysis are discussed.},

of programming languages. However many interesting problems involve
not just a language's structure but also the actual usage of the

rise to probabilistic context-free grammars. Interesting in their

theory is presented with examples. Some open questions are posed.},

A general class of models is proposed in which the mean direction and dispersion of a von Mises variate are related to the explanatory variables by general link functions. Appropriate regression diagnostics, estimation and testing procedures are developed for fitting the models. The meaning of "correlation" between an angular and a linear variable is clarified, and leads to a general notion of multiple correlation associated with the regression model. The methods are applied to a set of data arising from a study of movements of intertidal gastropods.},

@article{Alsheikh-Ali2011,
abstract = {Background
There is increasing interest to make primary data from published research publicly available. We aimed to assess the current status of making research data available in highly-cited journals across the scientific literature.


Methods and Results
We reviewed the first 10 original research papers of 2009 published in the 50 original research journals with the highest impact factor. For each journal we documented the policies related to public availability and sharing of data. Of the 50 journals, 44 (88\%) had a statement in their instructions to authors related to public availability and sharing of data. However, there was wide variation in journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data related to the research to just including a statement in the published manuscript that data can be available on request. Of the 500 assessed papers, 149 (30\%) were not subject to any data availability policy. Of the remaining 351 papers that were covered by some data availability policy, 208 papers (59\%) did not fully adhere to the data availability instructions of the journals they were published in, most commonly (73\%) by not publicly depositing microarray data. The other 143 papers that adhered to the data availability instructions did so by publicly depositing only the specific data type as required, making a statement of willingness to share, or actually sharing all the primary data. Overall, only 47 papers (9\%) deposited full primary raw data online. None of the 149 papers not subject to data availability policies made their full primary data publicly available.


Conclusion
A substantial proportion of original research papers published in high-impact journals are either not subject to any data availability policies, or do not adhere to the data availability instructions in their respective journals. This empiric evaluation highlights opportunities for improvement.},

According to this proposal the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) plays an important role in unification. Research in other domains of cognition indicates that left prefrontal cortex has the necessary neurobiological characteristics for its involvement in the unification for language. I offer here a psycholinguistic perspective on the nature of language unification and the role of LIFG.},

This paper draws on basic memory research to help distinguish these explanations and reports data from an experiment that manipulates the possibility for retrieval interference while holding encoding conditions constant. We found clear support for the principle of cue-overload, wherein cues available at retrieval cannot uniquely distinguish among competitors, thus giving rise to interference effects. We discuss the data in relation to a cue-based parsing framework (Van Dyke \{\&\} Lewis, 2003) and other interference effects observed in sentence processing (e.g., Gordon, Hendrick, \{\&\} Johnson, 2001, 2004). We conclude from the available data that the memory system that subserves language comprehension operates according to similar principles as memory in other domains.},

@article{Ferreira:2003,
abstract = {Research on language comprehension has focused on the resolution of syntactic ambiguities, and most studies have employed garden-path sentences to determine the system's preferences and to assess its use of nonsyntactic sources information. A topic that has been neglected is how syntactically challenging but essentially unambiguous sentences are processed, including passives and object-clefts--sentences that require thematic roles to be assigned in an atypical order. The three experiments described here tested the idea that sentences are processed both algorithmically and heuristically. Sentences were presented aurally and the participants' task was to identify the thematic roles in the sentence (e.g., Who was the do-er?). The first experiment demonstrates that passives are frequently and systematically misinterpreted, especially when they express implausible ideas. The second shows that the surface frequency of a syntactic form does not determine ease of processing, as active sentences and subject-clefts were comprehended equally easily despite the rareness of the latter type. The third experiment compares the processing of subject- and object-clefts, and the results show that they are similar to actives and passives, respectively, again despite the infrequent occurrence in English of any type of cleft. The results of the three experiments suggest that a comprehensive theory of language comprehension must assume that simple processing heuristics are used during processing in addition to (and perhaps sometimes instead of) syntactic algorithms.

This is referred to as information structure. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the role of information structure in semantic processing. Following different questions in wh-question-answer pairs (e.g. What kind of vegetable did Ming buy for cooking today?/Who bought the vegetables for cooking today?), the answer sentences (e.g., Ming bought eggplant/beef to cook today.) contained a critical word, which was either semantically appropriate (eggplant) or inappropriate (beef), and either focus or non-focus. The results showed a full N400 effect only when the critical words were in focus position. In non-focus position a strongly reduced N400 effect was observed, in line with the well-known semantic illusion effect. The results suggest that information structure facilitates semantic processing by devoting more resources to focused information.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The free and open sharing of information, data, and materials regarding published research is vital to the replication of published results, the efficient advancement of science, and the education of students. Yet in daily practice, the ideal of free sharing is often breached. OBJECTIVE: To understand the nature, extent, and consequences of data withholding in academic genetics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mailed survey (March-July 2000) of geneticists and other life scientists in the 100 US universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1998. Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified nongeneticists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share data. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of research. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.},

abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis
and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for
learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input
signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal
and application of principal component analysis to this expanded
signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal
solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract
a large number of decorrelated features, which are ordered by their
degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process
high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA
is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple
cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated
input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA.
Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a
simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network
can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser
degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending
on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training
objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The
generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance
degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances
simultaneously.},

abstract = {The electrophysiology of language comprehension has long been dominated by research on syntactic and semantic integration. However, to understand expressions like "he did it" or "the little girl", combining word meanings in accordance with semantic and syntactic constraints is not enough-readers and listeners also need to work out what or who is being referred to. We review our event-related brain potential research on the processes involved in establishing reference, and present a new experiment in which we examine when and how the implicit causality associated with specific interpersonal verbs affects the interpretation of a referentially ambiguous pronoun. The evidence suggests that upon encountering a singular noun or pronoun, readers and listeners immediately inspect their situation model for a suitable discourse entity, such that they can discriminate between having too many, too few, or exactly the right number of referents within at most half a second. Furthermore, our implicit causality findings indicate that a fragment like "David praised Linda because..." can immediately foreground a particular referent, to the extent that a subsequent "he" is at least initially construed as a syntactic error. In all, our brain potential findings suggest that referential processing is highly incremental, and not necessarily contingent upon the syntax. In addition, they demonstrate that we can use ERPs to relatively selectively keep track of how readers and listeners establish reference.},

In 9 experiments, we demonstrate that, unlike noun anaphors, pronouns sometimes do not produce relative facilitation of their referents in comparison with nonreferents.

abstract = {A recent controversy in the field of depth perception has highlighted an important aspect of model testing concerning a model's complexity, defined as the prior propensity of the model to fit arbitrary data sets. The present article introduces an index of complexity, called the mean minimum distance, defined as the average squared distance between an arbitrary data point and the prediction range of the model. It may also be expressed as a dimensionless quantity called the scaled mean minimum distance. For linear models, theoretical values for the scaled mean minimum distance and the variance of the scaled minimum distance can be readily obtained and compared against empirical estimates obtained from fits to random data. The approach is applied to resolving the question of the relative complexity of the Linear Integration model and the Fuzzy Logic of Perception model, both of which have been the subject of controversy in the field of depth perception. It is concluded that the two models are equally complex.},

abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

Easy C-in-O searches and difficult O-in-C searches are often associated with parallel and serial search, respectively. Here, the time course of visual search was measured for both tasks with speed-accuracy methods. The time courses of the 2 tasks were similar and independent of display size. New probabilistic parallel and serial search models and sophisticated-guessing variants made predictions about time course and accuracy of visual search. The probabilistic parallel model provided an excellent account of the data, but the serial model did not. Asymptotic search accuracies and display size effects were consistent with a signal-detection analysis, with lower variance encoding of Cs than Os. In the absence of eye movements, asymmetric visual search, long considered an example of serial deployment of covert attention, is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with parallel search processes.},

According to J. Jonides's (1983) 2-process model, there exist 2 possible modes of attentional readiness: a focused-attention mode and a diffuse-attention mode. Observers are assumed to enter the focused-attention mode on a proportion of trials that matches the validity of the cue and to enter the diffuse-attention mode on the remaining trials. The present experiment tested and rejected the response time mixture prediction of the 2-process model. An instance of the class of 1-process models in which perceptual objects are sampled in parallel according to the validity of the cue was evaluated. A stochastic simulation of the model yielded results that paralleled those of the experiment.},

The primary analyses focused on 7765 patients without neoadjuvant therapy. The most well-known finding is that of a surgical "learning curve", with rates of prostate cancer cure strongly dependent on surgeon experience. In this "data note", we provide the raw data set, as well as well-annotated programming code for the main analyses. Data include markers of cancer severity (stage, grade and prostate-specific antigen level), cancer outcome, and surgeon variables such as training and experience.},

We used a full factorial design that crossed referential ambiguity with semantic incoherence. Ambiguous anaphors elicited a sustained negative shift (Nref effect), and incoherent anaphors elicited an N400 effect. Simultaneously ambiguous and incoherent anaphors elicited an ERP pattern resembling that of the incoherent anaphors. These results suggest that semantic incoherence can preclude readers from engaging in anaphoric inferencing. Furthermore, approximately half of our participants unexpectedly showed common late positive effects to the three types of problematic anaphors. We relate the latter finding to recent accounts of what the P600 might reflect, and to the role of individual differences therein.},

from the analysis of mathematical models. Currentlymost comprehensive
models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose
an alternative model of eye movementcontrol, which includes three
new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation
of saccade timing from saccadetarget selection, and autonomous (random)
generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features
provide a commoncontrol mechanism for fixations, refixations, and
regressions. Consequently, the model is called SWIFT (Saccade-generation
withinhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations
are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation,
first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping
probabilities in first-pass analysis. The modelinherently produces
complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions
due to its underlying dynamical principles.},

The word either could be present or absent earlier in the sentence. When either was present, the material immediately following or was read more quickly, across both sentence types. In addition, there was evidence that readers misanalyzed the S-coordination structure as an NP-coordination structure only when either was absent. The authors interpret the results as indicating that the word either enabled readers to predict the arrival of a coordination structure; this predictive activation facilitated processing of this structure when it ultimately arrived, and in the case of S-coordination sentences, enabled readers to avoid the incorrect NP-coordination analysis. The authors argue that these results support parsing theories according to which the parser can build predictable syntactic structure before encountering the corresponding lexical input.},

abstract = {For every claim in the neuroimaging literature about a particular brain region supporting syntactic processing, there exist other claims implicating the target region in different linguistic processes, and, in many cases, in non-linguistic cognitive processes (e.g., Blumstein, 2009). We argue that traditional group analysis methods in neuroimaging may obscure functional specificity because of inter-subject anatomical variability (Fedorenko \& Kanwisher, 2009). In Fedorenko, Hsieh, Nieto-Castanon, Whitfield-Gabrieli, and Kanwisher (2010) we presented a functional localizer that allows quick and reliable identification of key language-sensitive regions in each individual brain. This approach enables pooling data from corresponding functional regions across subjects rather than from the same locations in stereotaxic space that may differ functionally due to inter-subject anatomical variability. In the current paper we demonstrate that the individual-subjects functional localization approach is superior to the traditional methods in its ability to distinguish among conditions in a brain region's response. This ability is at the core of all neuroimaging research and is critical for answering questions of functional specialization (e.g., does a brain region specialize for processing syntactic aspects of the linguistic signal), which is in turn essential for making inferences about the precise computations conducted in each brain region. Based on our results, we argue that supplementing existing methods with an individual-subjects functional localization approach may lead to a clearer picture of the neural basis of syntactic processing, as it has in some other domains, such as high-level vision (e.g., Kanwisher, 2010) and social cognition (e.g., Saxe \& Kanwisher, 2003).},

Cognitive Psychology, 6(1), 84-107; ]. We demonstrate here that such spontaneous fixation can be driven by partial semantic overlap between a word and a visual object. Participants heard the word 'piano' when (a) a piano was depicted amongst unrelated distractors; (b) a trumpet was depicted amongst those same distractors; and (c), both the piano and trumpet were depicted. The probability of fixating the piano and the trumpet in the first two conditions rose as the word 'piano' unfolded. In the final condition, only fixations to the piano rose, although the trumpet was fixated more than the distractors. We conclude that eye movements are driven by the degree of match, along various dimensions that go beyond simple visual form, between a word and the mental representations of objects in the concurrent visual field.},

These are accepted by many linguists, but a significant number of others still seem reluctant to accept them. The basic claim is that it is no longer tenable for syntactic theories to be constructed on the evidence of a single persons judgements, and that real progress can only be made when syntacticians begin to think more carefully about the empirical basis of their work and apply the minimum standards we propose. We advance two groups of rea- sons for syntacticians to do this, negative and positive. The negative stick group concerns the inadequacy of current practice. We argue that linguists are producing unsatisfactory work with these methods. Data quality is a limiting factor: a theory can only ever be as good as its data base. The positive carrot group concerns the descriptive and theoretical advantages which become available with more empiri- cally adequate data. We hope to tempt linguists to adopt new methods by showing them the insights which better data makes available.},

In secondary data analysis, documentation plays a critical role in transferring knowledge about data from data producers to secondary users. Despite its importance, documentation of social science data has rarely been the focus of existing studies. In this paper, based on an introduction of the concept of documentation and its role in secondary data analysis, the authors proposed the Quality Evaluation Model for Documentation (QEMD) of social science data. In the model, two indicators are used to evaluate the quality of documentation for social science data: sufficiency and ease of use. Then the authors review the sufficiency problems of documentation, identify three factors that affect the sufficiency of documentation: users, data and the ease-of-use of documentation, and formulate hypotheses about how those factors affect the sufficiency of documentation. In future research, a survey instrument will be created based on QEMD and the factors affecting the sufficiency of documentation. The survey instrument will then be applied to the secondary users of social science data. Hypotheses will be tested based on the survey data.},

The present study used event-related fMRI to examine the hitherto untested hypothesis that the violation of a linearization principle that is purely semantic in nature (animate arguments should precede inanimate arguments) would also lead to increased pars opercularis activation. To this end, we manipulated the features animacy and argument order in German sentences and found a significant increase of activation in the pars opercularis for a violation of the animacy principle even when the other factors mentioned above were controlled for. This result therefore calls for a "supra-syntactic" account of pars opercularis function in the real-time understanding of sentences.},

This data pattern suggested that a verb's semantic constraints do not affect initial syntactic ambiguity resolution. We repeated the experiment using: (1) inanimate noun/verb combinations that did not easily permit a main clause continuation, (2) a baseline condition with morphologically unambiguous verbs (e.g., stolen), (3) a homogeneous set of disambiguating prepositional phrases, and (4) a display in which all of the critical regions were presented on the same line of text. In two eye-movement experiments, animacy had immediate effects on ambiguity resolution: only animate nouns showed clear signs of difficulty. Post-hoc regression analyses revealed that what little processing difficulty readers had with the inanimate nouns varied with the semantic fit of individual noun/verb combinations: items with strong semantic fit showed no processing difficulty compared to unambiguous controls, whereas items with weak semantic fit showed a pattern of processing difficulty which was similar to Ferreira and Clifton (1986). The results are interpreted within the framework of an evidential (constraint-based) approach to ambiguity resolution. Analyses of reading times also suggested that the millisecond per character correction for region length is problematic, especially for small scoring regions. An alternative transformation is suggested.},

abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing
two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion,
called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information
lost and gained in changing from clustering to clustering . The basic
properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds
of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the
new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric
on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability
of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter
properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing
comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we
present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is
the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both
aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence,
we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there
is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies
the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

abstract = {The "Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials" (CONSORT) was developed to improve the suboptimal reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, little is known about the quality of reporting since this publication. We undertook an observational study to determine the quality of reporting key methodological factors in RCTs since the publication of the CONSORT statement and if a journal policy to promote adherence to the CONSORT checklist was associated with superior reporting. We recorded the reporting of 11 key methodological factors in 105 RCTs from 29 medical journals published subsequent to the CONSORT statement. We examined the quality of reporting in relation to whether a journal was a "CONSORT promoter" as defined by inclusion of the CONSORT checklist in a journal's "information to authors" section or a requirement that authors, manuscript reviewers, or copy editors complete the CONSORT checklist. Multivariate analysis controlled for journal impact factor, study outcome, and time of publication. Six of the 11 methodological factors were reported <50\% of the time. The number of methodological factors reported was greater in CONSORT promoters than in journals not promoting CONSORT in both unadjusted (6.0 and 5.1, respectively, p-value = 0.03) and adjusted (6.4 and 4.8 of the 11 methodological factors, respectively, p-value = 0.0001) analyses. While journals that promote CONSORT demonstrate superior reporting of RCTs, persistent inadequacies in reporting remain. Until these inadequacies are resolved health-care providers will remain limited in their ability to make informed inferences about the validity of the studies upon which they base their clinical practice.},

Bilingual Spanish/Catalan and monolingual Spanish subjects were instructed

ignoring words in the other language and pseudowords. The brain potentials
of bilingual subjects in response to words of the non-target language
were not sensitive to word frequency, indicating that the meaning

patterns of bilinguals included a number of areas previously implicated
in phonological and pseudoword processing, suggesting that bilinguals

When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. '... began the book' or '... enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

The data strongly suggest that these corpus-based measures of word semantics predict fixation behavior in the visual world and provide further evidence that language-mediated eye movements to objects in the concurrent visual environment are driven by semantic similarity rather than all-or-none categorical knowledge. The data suggest that the visual world paradigm can, together with other methodologies, converge on the evidence that may help adjudicate between different theoretical accounts of the psychological semantics.},

We hypothesized that the first-pass parsing processes are highly automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are more controlled. To test this hypothesis we varied the proportion of correct sentences and sentences containing phrase structure violations with incorrect sentences being either of a low (20\% violation) or a high (80\% violation) proportion. Results showed that the early left anterior negativity was elicited and equally pronounced under both proportion conditions. By contrast, the late positivity was elicited for a low proportion of incorrect sentences only. This data pattern suggests that first-pass parsing processes are automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are under participants' strategic control.},

We replicated previous experimental cue-validity effects relating to a spatial shift of attention within an object (spatial effect), to attention switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of attention toward the display centroid (attraction effect), also taking into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other trials. We simultaneously estimated variance/covariance components of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and attraction effects in addition to their mean reaction times (RTs). The spatial effect showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly at the cued location than fast subjects. We compare this joint LMM analysis of experimental effects and associated subject-related variances and correlations with two frequently used alternative statistical procedures.},

abstract = {In simple, go/no-go, and choice reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster to two redundant targets than to a single target. This redundancy gain has been explained in terms of a race model assuming that whichever target is processed faster determines RT (Raab, 1962). Miller (1982) presented a race model inequality to test the race model by comparing the RT distributions of single and redundant target conditions. Here, we present simulations indicating that the standard tests of this inequality (for a description of the testing algorithm, see Ulrich, Miller, \& Schr\"{o}ter, 2007) are afflicted with systematic biases and Type I error accumulation. Systematic biases tend to produce violations of the race model inequality, but they decrease as the numbers of observations increase. Reasonably unbiased tests of the race model inequality are obtained for sample sizes of at least 20 for each target condition. In addition, Type I error accumulates because of testing the inequality at multiple percentiles. To reduce Type I error, the race model inequality should be tested in a restricted range of percentiles, preferably in the percentile range 10\% to 25\%.},

@article{TongEtAl2007,
abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs) have been shown to be effective for a number
of tasks, including motor control, dynamic time series prediction,
and memorizing musical sequences. However, their performance on natural
language tasks has been largely unexplored until now. Simple Recurrent
Networks (SRNs) have a long history in language modeling and show
a striking similarity in architecture to ESNs. A comparison of SRNs
and ESNs on a natural language task is therefore a natural choice
for experimentation. Elman applies SRNs to a standard task in statistical
NLP: predicting the next word in a corpus, given the previous words.
Using a simple context-free grammar and an SRN with backpropagation
through time (BPTT), Elman showed that the network was able to learn
internal representations that were sensitive to linguistic processes
that were useful for the prediction task. Here, using ESNs, we show
that training such internal representations is unnecessary to achieve
levels of performance comparable to SRNs. We also compare the processing
capabilities of ESNs to bigrams and trigrams. Due to some unexpected
regularities of Elman’s grammar, these statistical techniques are
capable of maintaining dependencies over greater distances than might
be initially expected. However, we show that the memory of ESNs in
this word-prediction task, although noisy, extends significantly
beyond that of bigrams and trigrams, enabling ESNs to make good predictions
of verb agreement at distances over which these methods operate at
chance. Overall, our results indicate a surprising ability of ESNs
to learn a grammar, suggesting that they form useful internal representations
without learning them.},

abstract = {This article explores the intensity of processing during sentence
comprehension by measuring pupillary response during reading. Two
experiments contrast the processing of simpler versus more complex
sentences. The two more complex sentence types, object-relative center-embedded
sentences and filler-gap sentences, not only take longer to process
than their simpler counterparts, but they also produce a larger change
in pupil diameter. We propose that the pupillary response is an indicator
of how intensely the processing system is operating. The more complex
sentences evoke some intense processing at the point in the sentence
where a syntactic complexity is first encountered. The gaze durations
at these points are elevated, indicating the immediate response to
the demand of the syntactic processing. The pupil then starts to
dilate, reaching a maximal diameter approximately 1.3 s later. The
results from these various performance measures are integrated within
a resource-limited computational model of comprehension. The paper
develops a model of comprehension that includes an intensity dimension
of thought, drawing a correspondence between the computational model's
consumption of resources and the human pupillary response.},

(2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory.},

Here we investigate the extent to which these substantive conclusions depend on whether researchers use the Ratcliff diffusion model or the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. Simulations show that the models agree on the effects of changes in the rate of information accumulation and changes in non-decision time, but that they disagree on the effects of changes in response caution. In fits to empirical data, however, the models tend to agree closely on the effects of an experimental manipulation of response caution. We discuss the implications of these conflicting results, concluding that real manipulations of caution map closely, but not perfectly to response caution in either model. Importantly, we conclude that inferences about psychological processes made from real data are unlikely to depend on the model that is used.},

abstract = {Structurally segregated and functionally specialized regions of the
human cerebral cortex are interconnected by a dense network of cortico-cortical
axonal pathways. By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively
mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual
human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural
brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial
and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal
and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share
high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute
connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural
core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of
the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core
regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural
connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in
the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of
the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

abstract = {In reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are especially fast when participants can anticipate the onset of an imperative response signal. Although this RT facilitation is commonly attributed to temporal preparation, it is unclear whether this preparation shortens the duration of early or late processes. We used the effect propagation property of the psychological refractory period paradigm to localize the effect of temporal preparation. Manipulation of temporal uncertainty affected the RT of Task 1, regardless of the level of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Consistent with the prediction of an early locus of temporal preparation, this effect propagated completely to the RT of Task 2 at short SOAs, but propagation diminished virtually to zero at long SOAs.},

The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs the necessary calculations.},

We use the results of a survey conducted by the working groups of the DataONE project to present a new understanding of challenges to the development of global data collections and preservation by systematically examining the determinants of the researchers' likelihood to openly publish research data. This study found two key determinants affecting researchers' willingness to publish their data. First is data management in terms of data management skills and organization support. Second is the acknowledgement of the data set's originator in terms of appreciation and legal and policy requirements. This study also found that the impact of the significant determinants is contingent on the amount of data to be published. Finally, this study calls for further investigation to ascertain the relationship of data management and data quality, and systematic investigation on the roles and responsibility of government within these global data preservations.},

to high level abstract representations, and involving interpreting
stimuli and generating actions. In doing this, it will draw on multiple
sources of expertise, learned from experience, creating multiple,
often conflicting, hypotheses which are integrated by the action
of the thalamic neurons and then sent back to the standard input
layer of the cortex. Thus this nucleus plays the role of an 'active
blackboard' on which the current best reconstruction of some aspect
of the world is always displayed. Evidence for this theory is reviewed
and experimental tests are proposed. A sequel to this paper will
discuss the cortico-cortical loops and propose quite different computational
roles for them.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying reaction times have previously been modelled in two distinct ways. When stimuli are hard to detect, response time tends to follow a random-walk model that integrates noisy sensory signals. But studies investigating the influence of higher-level factors such as prior probability and response urgency typically use highly detectable targets, and response times then usually correspond to a linear rise-to-threshold mechanism. Here we show that a model incorporating both types of element in series - a detector integrating noisy afferent signals, followed by a linear rise-to-threshold performing decision - successfully predicts not only mean response times but, much more stringently, the observed distribution of these times and the rate of decision errors over a wide range of stimulus detectability. By reconciling what previously may have seemed to be conflicting theories, we are now closer to having a complete description of reaction time and the decision processes that underlie it.},

This difference was reversed when impersonal pronouns constituted the embedded noun phrase. This pattern of distribution provides a suitable framework for testing the role of experience in sentence processing: if frequency of exposure influences processing difficulty, highly frequent pronominal object relatives should be easier to process but only when a personal pronoun is in the embedded position. We tested this hypothesis experimentally: We conducted four self-paced reading tasks, which indicated that differences in pronominal object/subject relative processing mirrored the pattern of distribution revealed by the corpus analysis. We discuss the results in the light of current theories of sentence comprehension. We conclude that object relative processing is facilitated by frequency of the embedded clause, and, more generally, that statistical information should be taken into account by theories of relative clause processing.},

that pupil diameter may correlate closely with controlstate and associated

baseline diameter (but increases in task-evoked dilations) would
beassociated with task engagement (exploitation). Findings in three

A major part of the evidence for this process is a purported discontinuity in the mean response time (RT) versus numerosity curves at about 4 elements, when subjects enumerate up to 7 or more elements in a visual display. In this article, RT data collected in a speeded enumeration experiment are subjected to a variety of statistical analyses, including several tests on the RT distributions. None of these tests reveals a significant discontinuity as numerosity increases. The data do suggest a strong stochastic dominance in RT by display numerosity, indicating that the mental effort required to enumerate does increase with each additional element in the display, both within and beyond the putative subitizing range.},

Berg (1998) suggests that in morphologically impoverished previous termlanguagesnext term like English, low frequency of agreement operations makes for a weak morphosyntactic component that is unable to keep previous termsemanticnext term interference at bay, at least in production (where meaning comes first). In his completion study, he manages to show that the strong morphosyntactic defences of German do seem to encapsulate number agreement from non-formal forces. In this paper, I examine the psycholinguistic literature on the processing of agreement in English and Spanish in search of fine-grained evidence for encapsulation in all the relevant domains (NP, clausal, supra-clausal). The different grounding of the features of gender and number is also analysed and evidence for their differentiality in the first cycles of processing is ruled out. In general, Berg’s hypothesis is confirmed by existing processing measures (Spanish patterns like German due to its rich morphology), but the fine picture of agreement operations in English and Spanish is also sensitive to the different domains tested and to whether production or comprehension is taken into account. Finally, it is argued that gender classes and the agreement systems based on them constitute a major generative device when constructing the clause. This is because gender is less semantically grounded than number and therefore easier to recruit for phrasal packaging, as this merely requires the co-variance of form.},

abstract = {The present paper provides evidence that the processing of verb final clauses proceeds incrementally based on local information that becomes available with each word. The results of three self-paced reading experiments are reported in support of the proposal that NPs in Japanese are associated within clauses before a verb is processed. It is argued that a clause boundary is posited whenever case markers prevent two NPs from being part of the same clause, and slow reading times at the second NP are used as supporting evidence. Moreover, clause boundaries induced by case narking can facilitate processing at later points in the sentence as attested to by faster reading times at relative-clause heads. Contrary to previous findings that argued against a subclass of head-driven parsers, the present results are not easily reconcilable with any type of model that delays parsing decisions until a verb is available in the input sentence.},

abstract = {Two subject-verb agreement error elicitation studies tested the hierarchical feature-passing account of agreement computation in production and three timing-based alternatives: linear distance to the head noun, semantic integration, and a combined effect of both (a scope of planning account). In Experiment 1, participants completed subject noun phrase (NP) stimuli consisting of a head NP followed by two prepositional phrase (PP) modifiers, where the first PP modified the first NP, and the second PP modified one of the two preceding NPs. Semantic integration between the head noun and the local noun within each PP was held constant across structures. The mismatch error pattern showed an effect of linear distance to the head noun and no influence of hierarchical distance. In Experiment 2, participants completed NP PP PP stimuli in which both PPs modified the head noun, and both the order of the two PPs and the local nouns' degree of semantic integration with the head noun were varied. The pattern of mismatch errors reflected a combination of semantic integration and linear distance to the head noun. These studies indicate that agreement processes are strongly constrained by grammatical-level scope of planning, with local nouns planned closer to the head having a greater chance of interfering with agreement computation.},

that simple and complex span tasks largely measure the same basic
subcomponent processes (e.g., rehearsal, maintenance, updating, controlled
search) but differ in the extent to which these processes operate
in a particular task. These differences largely depend on the extent
to which phonological processes are maximized and variability from
long list lengths is present. Potential methodological, psychometric,

In our experiment, participants read part of a sentence ending in a high- or low-frequency target word and then made a long (40 degrees) or short (10 degrees) saccade to the rest of the sentence. We found a frequency effect on the target word and the first word after the saccade, but the effect was greater for short than for long saccades. Readers therefore performed more lexical processing during long saccades than during short ones. Hence, lexical processing takes place during saccades in text comprehension.},

QMPE enables users to estimate parameters for the ex-Gaussian and Gumbel (1958) distributions, along with three "shifted" distributions (i.e., distributions with a parameter-dependent lower bound): the Lognormal, Wald, and Weibul distributions. Estimation can be performed using either the standard continuous maximum likelihood (CML) method or quantile maximum probability (QMP; Heathcote \& Brown, in press). We review the properties of each distribution and the theoretical evidence showing that CML estimates fail for some cases with shifted distributions, whereas QMP estimates do not. In cases in which CML does not fail, a Monte Carlo investigation showed that QMP estimates were usually as good, and in some cases better, than CML estimates. However, the Monte Carlo study also uncovered problems that can occur with both CML and QMP estimates, particularly when samples are small and skew is low, highlighting the difficulties of estimating distributions with parameter-dependent lower bounds.},

data, without priorknowledge of the number of clusters or any other
information about their composition. Dataare represented by a mixture
model in which each component corresponds to a differentcluster.
Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian
components with different parameterizations and cross-cluster constraints.
Noise and outliers canbe modeled by adding a Poisson process component.
Partitions are determined by the EM(expectation-maximization) algorithm
for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical
clustering.Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes
factor based on the BayesianInformation Criterion (BIC); unlike significance
tests, this allows comparison of more thantwo models at the same
time, and removes the restriction that the models compared benested.
The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering
methodare solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover,
the EM result provides ameasure of uncertainty about the associated
classification of each data point.Examples are given, showing that
this approach can give performance that is much betterthan standard
procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping

abstract = {Eye movements of listeners were monitored to investigate how gender information and accessibility influence the initial processes of pronoun interpretation. Previous studies on this issue have produced mixed results, and several studies have concluded that gender cues are not automatically used during the early processes of pronoun interpretation (e.g. Garnham, A., Oakhill, J. \{\&\} Cruttenden, H. (1992). The role of implicit causality and gender cue in the interpretation of pronouns. Language and Cognitive Processes, 73 (4), 231-255; Greene, S. B., McKoon, G. \{\&\} Ratcliff, R. (1992). Pronoun resolution and discourse models. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 182, 266-283). In the two experiments presented here, participants viewed a picture with two familiar cartoon characters of either same or different gender. They listened to a text describing the picture, in which a pronoun referred to either the first, more accessible, character, or the second. (For example, Donald is bringing some mail to ¿Mickey/Minnie¿ while a violent storm is beginning. He's carrying an umbrellaellipsis.) The results of both experiments show rapid use of both gender and accessibility at approximately 200 ms after the pronoun offset.},

One member of this class of models is the Poisson counter model, in which evidence accrues in unit increments and the waiting time between increments is exponentially distributed. This paper generalizes the counter model to allow the Poisson event rate to vary with time. General expressions are obtained for the RT distributions for the two- and the m-alternative cases. Closed-form expressions are obtained for response probabilities under a proportional-rates assumption and for mean RT under conditions in which the integrated event rate increases as an arbitrary power of time. An application in the area of early vision is described, in which the Poisson event rates are proportional to the outputs of sustained and transient channels.},

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

Because most clinical investigators are not responsible for and do not anticipate data broadcast few include information about data sharing in their informed consent process. Model language is therefore urgently needed and should be responsive to research participants' attitudes and judgments. The purpose of this study was to describe research participants' attitudes and judgments about data release and their preferences for varying levels of control over decision-making. METHODS: Focus group sessions with patients and controls from a genetic study of epilepsy. RESULTS: Despite wide variation in judgments, there was general interest in receiving information and making decisions about data sharing. Participants preferred multiple data sharing options, but were more likely to consent to public data release when given fewer options. For existing samples most participants felt that genomic information should not be publicly released without explicit consent from research participants. CONCLUSIONS: Specific information about data sharing ought to be included in the consent process for all genetic research. These participants desire multiple data release options, but the effect, if any, on consent to public release deserves further investigation.},

first goal, although experimenter- and participant-administered reading
span tasks were equally reliable and induced similar types of strategies,
the extra time taken to implement strategies in the participant-administered

- two goals: influence administration method and relationship between processing and storage
- time for strategy-use in participant-administered version decreased correlations with reading comprehension and verbal SAT
- processing did not mediate relationship with comprehension, hence theories that focus on processing as an explanation are incomplete

        
- still unclear, what wmc tasks really measure
- engle, cantor and carullo (1992): partialling-out of strategy times increases correlation with operation span
- turley-ames \{\&\} whitfield (2003): training for application of a certain strategy increases operation span scores and their correlation with reading ability; their interpretation: individual differences in strategy-use suppress relationship between wmc and reading ability
- waters \{\&\} caplan (1996) allow self-pacing and observe greatly varying reading times at span size (2.2 to 11.5s)
- solution: minimize strategy-use as much as possible
- processing overlap theory: "\{\ldots\}the major reason for the correlation between reading span and comprehension is that the processing component of the reading span task mimics the requirements of the comprehension task(s)." (138
- resource sharing theory: processing and storage rely on shared resources
- time-based forgetting theory

        
1) what is the correlation between processing and storage?
- uninteresting: positive correlation between processing and recall (speed-accuracy tradeoff)
- more interesting: null (proc and storage independent) or negative correlation (recall somehow dependent on processing)

        
2) does sentence position affect processing time?
- resource-sharing: processing times should incrementally increase with sentence position (other two: no influence of sentence position on processing time)

        
3) do proc times mediate correlation between rst and comp?
- core question: why do complex memory measures better predict comprehension than simple storage measures?
- multiple regression and semi-partial correlation analyses
- mediation consistent with time-based forg. and overlap

        
4) do processing times improve the predictive value of the wmc scores?
- waters \{\&\} caplan (1996): processing and storage independent, processing major predictor
- "\{\ldots\}rather than partialling out processing times from span scores, it may be better to add them to the span scores." (139

        
experiment
- two parallel rst
- two times increasing set sizes with 3 sets per size (to compute cronbachs alpha and split-half rel.)
- experimenter-paced: experimenter presses button as soon as particpiant has finished reading the sentence (not really experimenter-paced, is it?)
- serial order if possible, otherwise not the last word first
- baseline reading speed
- word span
- comprehension tests from practice sat test
- strategy interviews
- two sessions per subject, each test twice
- fixed order
- rst: total number words recalled

        
results
- groups did not significiantly differ from each other
- corr should be equally high in both groups and higher than with word span
- but: higher in in exp-paced group
- sig interaction reading span x administration for reading comprehension and verbal sat
- when partialling out word span, reading span remained a significant predictor for comprehension only in the exp-adm condition
- different correlations with comp. and vsat cannot be explained in terms of internal reliablity
- nor in terms of outliers
- part-adm. more likely to use phonological rehearsal as strategy, but differences not substantial
- anova on reading span scores (wmc\~{}group): part.-adm scores sig. higher and reads sig. more slowly
- exp-adm: longer reading times and lower scores
- part.-adm: longer reading times and higher scores
- partialling out reading time lowered correlation in exp-adm group but raised it in part-adm; partialling out deleted differences in correlation magnitude between groups
- regression slopes no longer sig. different
- results strongly support hypothesis that lower correlations in part-adm are due to time to implement strategies

        
what is correlation between recall and processing times?
- negative correlation in exp-adm group (consistent with time-based forgetting and resource-sharing)
- positive correlation in part-adm group (like engle et al. 1992)

        
does sentence position affect processing time?
- sig. sentence position effect
- systematically related to recall scores (consistent with resource sharing hypothesis, inconsistent with the others)
- no sig correlation of recall with sentence position in part-adm (but of reading times with sentence position)

        
do reading times mediate correlation with comprehension?
- core question: do processing measures predict comprehension over and above reading span scores?
- in exp-adm group reading span still sig predictor, when all other predictors (reading times and sentence position slopes) contributed significantly
- both processing measures predicted comprehensino over and above wmc, word span and the interaction of the two in exp-adm
- other pattern in part-adm: reading span scores explained more variance when reading span times were included
- semipartial correlations: removed variance from word span and word span x reading span > correlation between reading span and comprehension not attributable to variance associated with word span
- exp-adm: semipartial correlation still significant
- part-adm: no sig correlation when word span partialled out

        
summary:
- processing measures do not account for much shared variance (inconsistent with time-based forgetting and processing overlap: both predict processing efficiency as key mediating variable)
- also inconsistent with resource-sharing theory
- results contradict all three theories
- z scores like waters \{\&\} caplan (1996) correlated between .82 and .83 in exp-adm and from .53 to .72 in part-adm > replication
- also waters-caplan: z score better with ndrt than recall alone
- here only small differences in exp-adm, but the same results in part-adm

        
general disc
- studies that did not find correlation between reading times and recall did probably allow strategy-use
- no improvement in exp-adm with z scores (waters-caplan)
- processing and storage not unrelated (contradicts overlap theory)
- linear position effect (contradicts overlap and forgetting, in line with sharing)
- missing mediation of correlation by processing times rules out all three theories
- adding processing times only improves correlation in the part-adm group, thus only a correction for strategy-application
- none of the theories is satisfactory, maybe inhibition or controlled attention can better explain what the task really measures

        
recommendations:
1) do not allow participant-paced reading
2) obtain rt measure
3) include measure of criterion validity

abstract = {Recently, there have been several reports of the neurophysiological correlates of language acquisition. These indicate that the infant's brain is able to discriminate different phonemes within the first 2 months of life, that knowledge about stress patterns and phonotactic rules is established between 5-12 months, and that phonotactic knowledge begins to interact with lexical-semantic processes between 12-14 months. Electrophysiological markers for lexical-semantic processes indicate that semantic processing of words in picture contexts is present at 14 months and for words in sentential contexts around 30 months. At 32 months, children demonstrate an adult-like electrophysiological response pattern to syntactic violations. The similarities between the brain response patterns observed in children and adults support the view that language develops in a continuous manner.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for academic surgery departments and to determine whether optimal portfolio strategies exist to maximize this funding. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: The NIH budget is expected to be relatively stable in the foreseeable future, with a modest 0.7\% increase from 2005 to 2006. Funding for basic and clinical science research in surgery is also not expected to increase. METHODS:: NIH funding award data for US surgery departments from 2002 to 2004 was collected using publicly available data abstracted from the NIH Information for Management, Planning, Analysis, and Coordination (IMPAC) II database. Additional information was collected from the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database regarding research area (basic vs. clinical, animal vs. human, classification of clinical and basic sciences). The primary outcome measures were total NIH award amount, number of awards, and type of grant. Statistical analysis was based on binomial proportional tests and multiple linear regression models. RESULTS:: The smallest total NIH funding award in 2004 to an individual surgery department was a single \{\$\}26,970 grant, whereas the largest was more than \{\$\}35 million comprising 68 grants. From 2002 to 2004, one department experienced a 336\% increase (greatest increase) in funding, whereas another experienced a 73\% decrease (greatest decrease). No statistically significant differences were found between departments with decreasing or increasing funding and the subspecialty of basic science or clinical research funded. Departments (n = 5) experiencing the most drastic decrease (total dollars) in funding had a significantly higher proportion of type K (P = 0.03) grants compared with departments (n = 5) with the largest increases in total funding; the latter group had a significantly increased proportion of type U grants (P = 0.01). A linear association between amount of decrease/increase was found with the average amount of funding per grant and per investigator (P < 0.01), suggesting that departments that increased their total funding relied on investigators with large amounts of funding per grant. CONCLUSIONS:: Although incentives to junior investigators and clinicians with secondary participation in research are important, our findings suggest that the best strategy for increasing NIH funding for surgery departments is to invest in individuals with focused research commitments and established track records of garnering large and multiple research grants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. CONCLUSIONS: We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

because the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation are

organized structure involved in voluntary-saccade target selection,
plays a causal role in microsaccade generation. Neurons in the foveal
portion of the SC increase their activity before and during microsaccades
with sizes of only a few minutes of arc and exhibit selectivity for
the direction and amplitude of these movements. Reversible inactivation
of these neurons significantly reduces microsaccade rate without
otherwise compromising fixation. These results, coupled with computational
modeling of SC activity, demonstrate that microsaccades are controlled
by the SC and explain the link between microsaccades and visual attention.},

Various models have captured the data, although each required that discrimination be distinct, in terms of the computational process, from familiarization. This article describes a simple recurrent network (SRN), equipped only with the assumption that it should predict what comes next, which models the data without distinguishing between familiarization and discrimination. To accomplish this, the SRN requires pre-training on a range of sequences instantiating different structures and different vocabulary items to those used subsequently during familiarization and test. Pre-training enables the network to avoid replacing structure acquired during familiarization with structure experienced at test. An equivalent enabling condition may underpin infants' resistance to catastrophic interference between the different structures and vocabulary items to which they are exposed.},

of the neural representations in the cerebral association cortex.
In inferior temporal cortex, which serves as the storehouse of visual
long-term memory, activation of mnemonic engrams through electric
stimulation results in imagery recall in humans, and neurons can
be dynamically activated by the necessity for memory recall in monkeys.
Neuropsychological studies and previous split-brain experiments predicted
that prefrontal cortex exerts executive control upon inferior temporal
cortex in memory retrieval; however, no neuronal correlate of this
process has ever been detected. Here we show evidence of the top-down
signal from prefrontal cortex. In the absence of bottom-up visual
inputs, single inferior temporal neurons were activated by the top-down
signal, which conveyed information on semantic categorization imposed
by visual stimulus-stimulus association. Behavioural performance
was severely impaired with loss of the top-down signal. Control experiments
confirmed that the signal was transmitted not through a subcortical
but through a fronto-temporal cortical pathway. Thus, feedback projections
from prefrontal cortex to the posterior association cortex appear
to serve the executive control of voluntary recall.},

abstract = {When one nerve cell acts on another, its postsynaptic effect can vary
greatly. In sensory systems, inputs from "drivers" can be differentiated
from those of "modulators." The driver can be identified as the transmitter
of receptive field properties; the modulator can be identified as
altering the probability of certain aspects of that transmission.
Where receptive fields are not available, the distinction is more
difficult and currently is undefined. We use the visual pathways,
particularly the thalamic geniculate relay for which much relevant
evidence is available, to explore ways in which drivers can be distinguished
from modulators. The extent to which the distinction may apply first
to other parts of the thalamus and then, possibly, to other parts
of the brain is considered. We suggest the following distinctions:
Cross-correlograms from driver inputs have sharper peaks than those
from modulators; there are likely to be few drivers but many modulators
for any one cell; and drivers are likely to act only through ionotropic
receptors having a fast postsynaptic effect whereas modulators also
are likely to activate metabotropic receptors having a slow and prolonged
postsynaptic effect.},

The experiments (two off-line studies and two visual-world eye-tracking experiments) investigate how syntactic and semantic factors guide the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives and how different kinds of information are integrated during real-time reference resolution. The results show that the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives in picture NP constructions is sensitive not only to purely structural information, as is commonly assumed in syntactically-oriented theories of anaphor resolution, but also to semantic information (see Kuno, S. (1987). Functional syntax: Anaphora, discourse and empathy. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Tenny, C. (2003). Short distance pronouns in representational noun phrases and a grammar of sentience. Ms.). Moreover, the results show that pronouns and reflexives differ in the degree of sensitivity they exhibit to different kinds of information.

abstract = {A number of recent studies have argued that grammatical illusions can arise in the process of completing linguistic dependencies, such that unlicensed material is temporarily treated as licensed due to the presence of a potential licensor that is semantically appropriate but in a syntactically inappropriate position. A frequently studied case involves illusory licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) like ever and any, which must appear in the scope (i.e., c-command domain) of a negative element. Speakers often show intrusive licensing effects in sentences where an NPI is preceded but not c-commanded by a negative element, as in ( *)The restaurants that no newspapers have recommended in their reviews have ever gone out of business. Existing accounts of intrusive licensing have focused on the role of general memory retrieval processes. In contrast, we propose that intrusive licensing of NPIs reflects semantic/pragmatic processes that are more specific to NPI licensing. As a test of this claim, we present results from an ERP study that presents a structurally matched comparison of intrusive licensing in two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herself. In the absence of a potential licensor, both NPIs and reflexives elicit a P600 response, but whereas there is an immediate ERP analog of the intrusion effect for NPI licensing, no such effect is found for reflexive binding. This suggests that the NPI intrusion effect does not reflect general-purpose retrieval mechanisms.},

In contrast, reflexive binding reflects a process that more straightforwardly makes explicit reference to previously processed items and structure.At first glance NPI licensing shares important commonalities with the processing of anaphora, and with reflexives in particular. Both phenomena typically require a licensor in a structurally appropriate position.the human parser can use structural constraints to guide its operationsa number of studies indicate that when completing a wh-dependency, comprehenders are sensitive to island constraints, such that the well-known `active' gap construction mechanisms are inoperative in domains that span island boundaries (e.g., Phillips, 2006; Stowe, 1986; Traxler \{\&\} Pickering, 1996)A particularly relevant example for this study is an eye-tracking study by Sturt (2003) on the processing of reflexives like himself and herself, which demonstrated a retrieval mechanism that appears to immediately respect grammatical constraints on antecedents for reflexives.responses in the inaccessible licensor condition were both slower and less accurate than in the other two conditionsan N400 component was elicited in both ungrammatical conditionsVasishth et al. (2008) demonstrated faster reading times for sentences with an intrusive licensor than for sentences with no licensor, but only in later reading time measures such as second pass fixations.Vasishth, Lewis and their colleagues (Lewis, Vasishth, \{\&\} Van Dyke, 2006; Vasishth, Drenhaus, Saddy, \{\&\} Lewis, 2005) have argued that the intrusion effect in NPI licensing reflects a general cue-based memory retrieval mechanism that is sensitive to partial cue overlap(7a) shows that when an NPI is within the semantic scope of a negation, it can be licensed, even though it is not syntactically c-commanded by the negation. (7b) shows that the same is not true of reflexive binding, which requires the antecedent to c-command the reflexive.In (5a) the search yields a licensor that matches both cues, and in (5c) the search fails to find a match to either cue. In (5b) the search yields only a partially matched item---a semantically appropriate licensor that is in an inappropriate position. However, this partial cue overlap, coupled with stochastic fluctuation in base activation levels, may be sufficient for the structurally inaccessible licensor to be retrieved and treated as a licensor for the NPI ever on some percentage of trials.There is a broad consensus among current leading theories of negative polarity phenomena that NPI licensing reflects an interaction between the lexical properties of NPIs and the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions (e.g., Chierchia, 2006; Fauconnier, 1975; Giannakidou, 1998; Israel, 2004; Kadmon \{\&\} Landman, 1993; Krifka, 1995; Ladusaw, 1992), rather than a direct structural relation between the NPI and a licensing item.much work in linguistics suggests that NPI licensing and reflexive binding involve substantially different relations. Specifically, whereas reflexive binding involves dependencies between two specific syntactic constituents, many studies of NPI licensing have concluded that NPIs are licensed by the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions, rather than involving dependencies with specific lexical items.Since the reflexive binding relation is more easily classified as an item-to-item dependency it may be a better candidate for testing the predictions of a retrieval-based model such as ACT-R.The contrasting findings about NPI licensing and reference resolution may reflect the different methodologies that have been used across studies, or they may reflect fundamental differences in the two phenomenaIn this study, we compared the intrusion effect on NPI licensing and reflexive binding in the same structural configurations and in the same experiment, using ERP recordings, which offer a fine-grained and continuous measure of brain activity.wo sets of items, one set for the test of NPI licensing and another for the test of reflexive bindingtwo types of unacceptable sentence. The first type of unacceptable sentence contained no potential licensor for the NPI or reflexive, and the second type of unacceptable sentence contained a potential licensor in a structurally inappropriate positionThe two grammatical control conditions had NPI licensors (`no' and `very few') in main clause subject position. The two intrusive conditions included the same potential NPI licensors, but in the subject position of the relative clause. In the no licensor condition the NPI licensor was replaced with the quantifier most, which retains the quantificational force of the sentences used in the other conditions but fails to license NPIs.if the intrusive licensing effect appears in the ERP record as soon as any effect of ungrammaticality, then we may conclude that intrusion impedes the ability of speakers to detect grammatical errors, making a true `illusion of grammaticality'Since overt negation is a stereotypical licensor for NPIs, it is possible that intrusive licensing might reflect the high cooccurrence frequency between no and ever.In order to address the possibility that intrusive NPI licensing might reflect frequent lexical associations, we tested both the highly frequent licensor no and the less common licensor few (2\% cooccurrence frequency with ever).Previous studies have shown that gender-stereotyped nouns cause comprehender to make an early commitment to the gender of the referent, and that this commitment is strong enough to cause processing disruption upon reading a mismatching reflexive (Osterhout, Bersick, \{\&\} McLaughlin, 1997; Sturt, 2003).Among the 210 filler items, 150 had similar structures and used similar determiners to the NPI conditions, but without the NPI ever.with the gender stereotype of the main clause subject.

abstract = {Background: The ability to locate publicly available gene expression microarray datasets effectively and efficiently facilitates the reuse of these potentially valuable resources. Centralized biomedical databases allow users to query dataset metadata descriptions, but these annotations are often too sparse and diverse to allow complex and accurate queries. In this study we examined the ability of PubMed article identifiers to locate publicly available gene expression microarray datasets, and investigated whether the retrieved datasets were representative of publicly available datasets found through statements of data sharing in the associated research articles. Results: In a recent article, Ochsner and colleagues identified 397 studies that had generated gene expression microarray data. Their search of the full text of each publication for statements of data sharing revealed 203 publicly available datasets, including 179 in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or ArrayExpress databases. Our scripted search of GEO and ArrayExpress for PubMed identifiers of the same 397 studies returned 160 datasets, including six not found by the original search for data sharing statements. As a proportion of datasets found by either method, the search for data sharing statements identified 91.4\% of the 209 publicly available datasets, compared to only 76.6\% found by our search carried out using PubMed identifiers. Searching GEO or ArrayExpress alone retrieved 63.2\% and 46.9\% of all available datasets, respectively. There was no difference in the type of datasets found by PubMed identifier searches in terms of research theme or the technology used. However, the studies identified were more likely to have larger sample sizes, were more frequently cited, and published in higher impact journals. Conclusions: Searching database entries using PubMed identifiers can identify the majority of publicly available datasets, but caution is required when this method is used to collect data for policy evaluation since studies in low impact journals are disproportionately excluded. We urge authors of all datasets to complete the citation fields for their dataset submissions once publication details are known, thereby ensuring their work has maximum visibility and can contribute to subsequent studies.},

abstract = {The present fMRI study aimed at identifying neural correlates of the syntax-semantics interface in language comprehension. This was achieved by examining what we refer to as "argument hierarchy construction", i.e., determining which participant in a sentence is the "Actor" and which is the "Undergoer" of the event expressed by the verb. In order to identify the neural bases of argument hierarchy processing, we manipulated three factors known to influence the complexity of argument hierarchy construction in German, namely argument order, verb class and morphological ambiguity. Increased argument hierarchization demands engendered enhanced activation in a network of inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal, premotor and parietal areas. Moreover, components of this network were differentially modulated by the individual factors. In particular, the left posterior superior temporal sulcus showed an enhanced sensitivity for morphological information and the syntactic realization of the verb-based argument hierarchy, while the activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) corresponded to linearization demands and was independent of morphological information. We therefore argue that, for German, posterior superior temporal and inferior frontal regions engage in the extraction of actorhood from morphosyntactic structure and in the sequential realization of hierarchical interpretive dependencies, respectively.},

We report two self-paced reading experiments which demonstrate clear differences in the magnitude of garden path effects associated with different types of structural change. However, difficulty of reanalysis was not affected by the position of the head noun within the ambiguous phrase.

These publications received 200 citations, of which 80 (40.0\%) were self-citations by Breuning or his coauthors. Tracked over time, non--self-citations declined sharply in 1986 and later years, coinciding with disclosure of Breuning's fraud. The data indicated that, in this case, researchers effectively shunned work known to be or even suspected of being falsified. Unique citation contexts (101) were examined to see how citing authors used Breuning's work: 33 were negative (disagreed with findings/methods), 10 positive (agreed), and 58 neutral (no valuation). Also, 63 were inconsequential (no influence on the citing author's analysis/conclusion). Thirty-eight were material, but 21 of these led to negative conclusions. These data diminish the apparent impact of Breuning's work suggested by total citations alone.},

abstract = {The question as to whether humans perceive, remember, or cognize psychological items simultaneously (i.e., in parallel) or sequentially (i.e., serially) has been of interest to philosophers and psychologists since at least the 19th century. The advent of the information-processing approach to cognition in the 1960s reopened the inquiry, initiating a flood of experiments and models in the literature. Surprisingly for so elemental an issue, persuasive experimental tests have, until recently, proven rather elusive. Several decades of theoretical, methodological, and experimental effort, propelled and shaped by a meta-theoretical perspective, are leading to powerful strategies for assessing this and related cognitive issues. The present article reviews the theoretical and empirical history of these inquiries and details situations in which decisive experimental tests are possible.},

Recent studies suggest, however, that the processes engaged during sentence comprehension are contingent on word presentation rate. These findings underscore the importance of allowing participants to read at a natural pace. The present study employed simultaneous self-paced reading and ERP methodologies to examine behavioral and neural responses while participants read sentences containing pragmatic or morphosyntactic violations or no violations. ERP and self-paced reading results replicated previous findings. This novel combination of behavioral and ERP methodologies combines the high temporal resolution and direct neural measures offered by ERPs with the more natural reading environment and information about processing load provided by self-paced reading.},

abstract = {The achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is currently regarded as a priority for biological and bio-medical research. Empirical evaluations of data sharing may be regarded as an indispensable first step in the identification of critical aspects and the development of strategies aimed at increasing availability of research data for the scientific community as a whole. Research concerning human genetic variation represents a potential forerunner in the establishment of widespread sharing of primary datasets. However, no specific analysis has been conducted to date in order to ascertain whether the sharing of primary datasets is common-practice in this research field. To this aim, we analyzed a total of 543 mitochondrial and Y chromosomal datasets reported in 508 papers indexed in the Pubmed database from 2008 to 2011. A substantial portion of datasets (21.9\%) was found to have been withheld, while neither strong editorial policies nor high impact factor proved to be effective in increasing the sharing rate beyond the current figure of 80.5\%. Disaggregating datasets for research fields, we could observe a substantially lower sharing in medical than evolutionary and forensic genetics, more evident for whole mtDNA sequences (15.0\% vs 99.6\%). The low rate of positive responses to e-mail requests sent to corresponding authors of withheld datasets (28.6\%) suggests that sharing should be regarded as a prerequisite for final paper acceptance, while making authors deposit their results in open online databases which provide data quality control seems to provide the best-practice standard. Finally, we estimated that 29.8\% to 32.9\% of total resources are used to generate withheld datasets, implying that an important portion of research funding does not produce shared knowledge. By making the scientific community and the public aware of this important aspect, we may help popularize a more effective culture of data sharing.},

The model is a composition of two first-level models for dichotomous responses and response times along with multivariate normal models for their item and person parameters. It is shown how the item parameters can easily be estimated using Fisher's identity. To test the fit of the model, Lagrange multiplier tests of the assumptions of subpopulation invariance of the item parameters (i.e., no differential item functioning), the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were derived. Simulation studies were used to show the feasibility of the estimation and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the latter. In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized adaptive test of language comprehension.},

@article{Stoltzfus2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Recently, various evolution-related journals adopted policies to encourage or require archiving of phylogenetic trees and associated data. Such attention to practices that promote sharing of data reflects rapidly improving information technology, and rapidly expanding potential to use this technology to aggregate and link data from previously published research. Nevertheless, little is known about current practices, or best practices, for publishing trees and associated data so as to promote re-use. FINDINGS: Here we summarize results of an ongoing analysis of current practices for archiving phylogenetic trees and associated data, current practices of re-use, and current barriers to re-use. We find that the technical infrastructure is available to support rudimentary archiving, but the frequency of archiving is low. Currently, most phylogenetic knowledge is not easily re-used due to a lack of archiving, lack of awareness of best practices, and lack of community-wide standards for formatting data, naming entities, and annotating data. Most attempts at data re-use seem to end in disappointment. Nevertheless, we find many positive examples of data re-use, particularly those that involve customized species trees generated by grafting to, and pruning from, a much larger tree. CONCLUSIONS: The technologies and practices that facilitate data re-use can catalyze synthetic and integrative research. However, success will require engagement from various stakeholders including individual scientists who produce or consume shareable data, publishers, policy-makers, technology developers and resource-providers. The critical challenges for facilitating re-use of phylogenetic trees and associated data, we suggest, include: a broader commitment to public archiving; more extensive use of globally meaningful identifiers; development of user-friendly technology for annotating, submitting, searching, and retrieving data and their metadata; and development of a minimum reporting standard (MIAPA) indicating which kinds of data and metadata are most important for a re-useable phylogenetic record.},

@article{Levy2011,
abstract = {In most languages, most of the syntactic dependency relations found in any given sentence are projective: the word-word dependencies in the sentence do not cross each other. Some syntactic dependency relations, however, are non-projective: some of their word-word dependencies cross each other. Non-projective dependencies are both rarer and more computationally complex than projective dependencies; hence, it is of natural interest to investigate whether there are any processing costs specific to non-projective dependencies, and whether factors known to influence processing of projective dependencies also affect non-projective dependency processing. We report three self-paced reading studies, together with corpus and sentence completion studies, investigating the comprehension difficulty associated with the non-projective dependencies created by the extraposition of relative clauses in English. We find that extraposition over either verbs or prepositional phrases creates comprehension difficulty, and that this difficulty is consistent with probabilistic syntactic expectations estimated from corpora. Furthermore, we find that manipulating the expectation that a given noun will have a postmodifying relative clause can modulate and even neutralize the difficulty associated with extraposition. Our experiments rule out accounts based purely on derivational complexity and/or dependency locality in terms of linear positioning. Our results demonstrate that comprehenders maintain probabilistic syntactic expectations that persist beyond projective-dependency structures, and suggest that it may be possible to explain observed patterns of comprehension difficulty associated with extraposition entirely through probabilistic expectations.},

Conventional statistical analysis cannot support them; Bayesian analysis

vague alternative, because the vaguer the alternative is (the more
it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the
null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute
the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on
the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach
1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect
approaches 0, then the data favor the null over any vaguer alternative
to it. The simple computations and the intuitive graphic representation
of the analysis are illustrated by the analysis of diverse examples
from the current literature. They pose 3 common experimental questions:

additive?},

abstract = {Syntax is one of the components in the architecture of language processing that allows the listener/reader to bind single-word information into a unified interpretation of multiword utterances. This paper discusses ERP effects that have been observed in relation to syntactic processing. The fact that these effects differ from the semantic N400 indicates that the brain honors the distinction between semantic and syntactic binding operations. Two models of syntactic processing attempt to account for syntax-related ERP effects. One type of model is serial, with a first phase that is purely syntactic in nature (syntax-first model). The other type of model is parallel and assumes that information immediately guides the interpretation process once it becomes available. This is referred to as the immediacy model. ERP evidence is presented in support of the latter model. Next, an explicit computational model is proposed to explain the ERP data. This Unification Model assumes that syntactic frames are stored in memory and retrieved on the basis of the spoken or written word form input. The syntactic frames associated with the individual lexical items are unified by a dynamic binding process into a structural representation that spans the whole utterance. On the basis of a meta-analysis of imaging studies on syntax, it is argued that the left posterior inferior frontal cortex is involved in binding syntactic frames together, whereas the left superior temporal cortex is involved in retrieval of the syntactic frames stored in memory. Lesion data that support the involvement of this left frontotemporal network in syntactic processing are discussed.},

abstract = {The application of mass spectrometry to discover new cancer biomarkers is in its infancy. Many of these new markers are low-abundance proteins that exist as fragments associated with carrier proteins. Although reproducibility is key to the use of mass spectrometry for ion fingerprint analysis, the scientific community has yet to establish a common platform or standardized operating procedures that are necessary for intra- and inter-laboratory comparison. In an effort to assist others who are perfecting mass spectrometry platforms for profiling, ongoing experimental data were posted for public consumption. An unintended consequence of unrestricted access to experimental data is the risk of inappropriate conclusions drawn and publicly disseminated that could have been avoided by communication between the producers and consumers of the data. Such disputes, however, should not divert us from the validation of this promising new approach.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computer system for understanding English. The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog.
It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language--syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system.},

the role of storage costs associatedwith maintaining incomplete syntactic
dependencies in structural ambiguity resolution. We argue that previouswork
has been equivocal regarding syntactic influences because it has
examined ambiguities where there is littleor no resource differential
between competing alternatives. The candidate structures of the ambiguities
exploredhere incur substantially different storage costs. The results
indicate that storage-based biases can be sufficientlypowerful to
create difficulty for a structural alternative even when it is promoted
by nonsyntactic factors. Thesefindings are incorporated into a model
of ambiguity resolution in which structural biases operate as independentgraded
constraints in selecting between structural alternatives. },

From Duplicate 1 ( Covert shifts of attention precede involuntary eye movements - Peterson, M S; Kramer, A F; Irwin, D E )

        
BACKGROUND
Involuntary saccades: Reaction to a sudden luminance change
According to Mokler and Fischer (1999), involuntary saccades are not preceded by covert attention shifts, because subjects are not aware of involuntary eye movements.

        

        
AIM
Find out if covert attention and overt attention are coupled when faced with endogenous and exogenous cues simultaneously.

        

        
BASIC DESIGN
- Six grey circles flip color, except for one. In addition, an additional distractor circle (called "onset"!?) appears, that Ss have to move their eyes to.
- Before any eye movement takes place the "onset" circle contains a probe letter, which is congruent or incongruent with the response target in the grey circle. The probe is big enough to be recognized without an eye movement. 
- The grey circle sometimes contains the response target right away, sometimes only once the eyes have landed (technically, once the eye have moved). At the beginning of the first eye movement, the probe disappears.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 1:
Setup like described in the basic design. Letters shown before first saccade onset were only sometimes the ones shown after the saccade. Congruency effects (old target=new target?, and old distractor=new target?) are of interest here.
Results:
- initial saccade went to toarget more often than to the distractor
- saccade latencies (of initial saccade) were shorter if eyes went to distractor
(- many more secondary saccades from distractor to target than from target to distractor
- if they went from target to distractor, saccades were slower
)
(a) When initial saccade went straight to TARGET, the only congruency that had an effect was the congruency between old target and new target
(b) When initial saccade went to DISTRACTOR, both congruency effects appeared, old target=new target and old distractor=new target. (The former was facilitating, while the latter had an adverse effect.

        

        
Effects (a) and (b) support the idea that attention shift to target is necessary to move your eyes there, and moving eyes to target prevents attention from wandering to distractor, i.e. that attention and voluntary eye movements are *very*tightly coupled. For involuntary eye-movements, however, there seems to be no such close link, since information from the target is also picked up, before the eyes move to the distractor. OR, as the authors suggest, the two attentional systems have different time courses and (b) can be explained in a setting, when attention moves to the distractor first, and then to the target, before the eyes have even moved there. [pretty cool!] 
Thus attention movement pattern is supposed to be quite similar to eye movment patterns, which are more likeley to go from distractor to target than from target to distractor on the second saccade, with the former also being faster than the latter.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 2:
Same setup, with one catch. Old target and old distractor are either shown early (0 to 100ms after color flip), or late (100-?ms after color filp).

        

        
Results:
When presentation is EARLY:
(a.1) When the initial saccade goes to TARGET, there is only a target congruency effect.
(b.1) When the initial saccade goes to DISTRACTOR, there is only a distractor congruency effect.
When presentation is LATE:
Same effect as in Experiment 1.
The EARLY effect is different, because there is not enough time to shift attention to both. 

        

        
CONCLUSIONS:
Attention can precede eye movements.

 From Duplicate 1 ( Covert shifts of attention precede involuntary eye movements - Peterson, M S; Kramer, A F; Irwin, D E )

        
BACKGROUND
Involuntary saccades: Reaction to a sudden luminance change
According to Mokler and Fischer (1999), involuntary saccades are not preceded by covert attention shifts, because subjects are not aware of involuntary eye movements.

        

        
AIM
Find out if covert attention and overt attention are coupled when faced with endogenous and exogenous cues simultaneously.

        

        
BASIC DESIGN
- Six grey circles flip color, except for one. In addition, an additional distractor circle (called "onset"!?) appears, that Ss have to move their eyes to.
- Before any eye movement takes place the "onset" circle contains a probe letter, which is congruent or incongruent with the response target in the grey circle. The probe is big enough to be recognized without an eye movement. 
- The grey circle sometimes contains the response target right away, sometimes only once the eyes have landed (technically, once the eye have moved). At the beginning of the first eye movement, the probe disappears.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 1:
Setup like described in the basic design. Letters shown before first saccade onset were only sometimes the ones shown after the saccade. Congruency effects (old target=new target?, and old distractor=new target?) are of interest here.
Results:
- initial saccade went to toarget more often than to the distractor
- saccade latencies (of initial saccade) were shorter if eyes went to distractor
(- many more secondary saccades from distractor to target than from target to distractor
- if they went from target to distractor, saccades were slower
)
(a) When initial saccade went straight to TARGET, the only congruency that had an effect was the congruency between old target and new target
(b) When initial saccade went to DISTRACTOR, both congruency effects appeared, old target=new target and old distractor=new target. (The former was facilitating, while the latter had an adverse effect.

        

        
Effects (a) and (b) support the idea that attention shift to target is necessary to move your eyes there, and moving eyes to target prevents attention from wandering to distractor, i.e. that attention and voluntary eye movements are *very*tightly coupled. For involuntary eye-movements, however, there seems to be no such close link, since information from the target is also picked up, before the eyes move to the distractor. OR, as the authors suggest, the two attentional systems have different time courses and (b) can be explained in a setting, when attention moves to the distractor first, and then to the target, before the eyes have even moved there. [pretty cool!] 
Thus attention movement pattern is supposed to be quite similar to eye movment patterns, which are more likeley to go from distractor to target than from target to distractor on the second saccade, with the former also being faster than the latter.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 2:
Same setup, with one catch. Old target and old distractor are either shown early (0 to 100ms after color flip), or late (100-?ms after color filp).

        

        
Results:
When presentation is EARLY:
(a.1) When the initial saccade goes to TARGET, there is only a target congruency effect.
(b.1) When the initial saccade goes to DISTRACTOR, there is only a distractor congruency effect.
When presentation is LATE:
Same effect as in Experiment 1.
The EARLY effect is different, because there is not enough time to shift attention to both. 

        

        
CONCLUSIONS:
Attention can precede eye movements.

abstract = {Newly discovered true (non-null) associations often have inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association approached with different analytic choices) can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.},

The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at successive points gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive load.},

abstract = {When confronted with a previously encountered scene, what information is used to guide search to a known target? We contrasted the role of a scene's basic-level category membership with its specific arrangement of visual properties. Observers were repeatedly shown photographs of scenes that contained consistently but arbitrarily located targets, allowing target positions to be associated with scene content. Learned scenes were then unexpectedly mirror reversed, spatially translating visual features as well as the target across the display while preserving the scene's identity and concept. Mirror reversals produced a cost as the eyes initially moved toward the position in the display in which the target had previously appeared. The cost was not complete, however; when initial search failed, the eyes were quickly directed to the target's new position. These results suggest that in real-world scenes, shifts of attention are initially based on scene identity, and subsequent shifts are guided by more detailed information regarding scene and object layout.},

abstract = {In layer 4 of cat visual cortex, the monocular, concentric receptive
fields of thalamic neurons, which relay retinal input to the cortex,
are transformed into 'simple' cortical receptive fields that are
binocular and selective for the precise orientation, direction of
motion, and size of the visual stimulus. These properties are thought
to arise from the pattern of connections from thalamic neurons, although
anatomical studies show that most excitatory inputs to layer 4 simple
cells are from recurrently connected circuits of cortical neurons.
We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons. We examined
single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons in slices of cat visual
cortex, and conclude that thalamocortical synapses are powerful and
the responses they evoke are unusually invariant for central synapses.
However, the responses to intracortical inputs, although less invariant,
are strong enough to provide most of the excitation to simple cells
in vivo. Our results suggest that the recurrent excitatory circuits
of cortex may amplify the initial feedforward thalamic signal, subserving
dynamic modifications of the functional properties of cortical neurons.},

In the experiment, subjects read sentences that contained either a critical high- or low-frequency target word. High- and low-frequency targets were matched on word length and a number of other variables. In one condition, parafoveal visual information to the right of the fixated word was denied or distorted; in other conditions, information about the parafoveal word to the right of the fixated word was available. The main results showed shorter fixations on high-frequency than on low-frequency target words. Furthermore, readers gained more effective previews from high-frequency parafoveal target words than from low-frequency parafoveal target words.},

abstract = {In 3 experiments, the author examined how readers’ eye movements are influenced by joint manipulations of a word’s frequency and the syntactic fit of the word in its context. In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, \& McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models. },

abstract = {Both notional and grammatical number affect agreement during language production. To explore their workings, we investigated how semantic integration, a type of conceptual relatedness, produces variations in agreement (Solomon \& Pearlmutter, 2004). These agreement variations are open to competing notional and lexical-grammatical number accounts. The notional hypothesis is that changes in number agreement reflect differences in referential coherence: More coherence yields more singularity. The lexical-grammatical hypothesis is that changes in agreement arise from competition between nouns differing in grammatical number: More competition yields more plurality. These hypotheses make opposing predictions about semantic integration. On the notional hypothesis, semantic integration promotes singular agreement. On the lexical-grammatical hypothesis, semantic integration promotes plural agreement. We tested these hypotheses with agreement elicitation tasks in two experiments. Both experiments supported the notional hypothesis, with semantic integration creating faster and more frequent singular agreement. This implies that referential coherence mediates the effect of semantic integration on number agreement.},

In Experiment 1, no differences between individuals with a low, medium, and high span were observed in how they distributed processing time between task elements. In all three groups, fixation times on words up to the to-be-remembered (TBR) word became shorter and the time spent on the TBR longer as memory load in the task increased. The results of Experiment 2, however, show that span groups differ in the use of memory encoding strategies: individuals with a low span use mainly rehearsal, whereas individuals with a high span use almost exclusively semantic elaboration. The results indicate that the use of elaborative strategies may enhance span performance but that not all individuals are necessarily able to use such strategies efficiently.},

abstract = {Results from two self-paced reading experiments in English are reported in which subject- and object-extracted relative clauses (SRCs and ORCs, respectively) were presented in contexts that support both types of relative clauses (RCs). Object-extracted versions were read more slowly than subject-extracted versions across both experiments. These results are not consistent with a decay-based working memory account of dependency formation where the amount of decay is a function of the number of new discourse referents that intervene between the dependents (Gibson, 1998; Warren \& Gibson, 2002). Rather, these results support interference-based accounts and decay-based accounts where the amount of decay depends on the number of words or on the type of noun phrases that intervene between the dependents. In Experiment 2, presentation in supportive contexts was directly contrasted with presentation in null contexts. Whereas in the null context the extraction effect was only observed during the RC region, in a supportive context the extraction effect was numerically larger and persisted into the following region, thus showing that extraction effects are enhanced in supportive contexts. A sentence completion study demonstrated that the rate of SRCs versus ORCs was similar across null and supportive contexts (with most completions being subject-extractions), ruling out the possibility that an enhanced extraction effect in supportive contexts is due to ORCs being less expected in such contexts. However, the content of the RCs differed between contexts in the completions, such that the RCs produced in supportive contexts were more constrained, reflecting the lexical and semantic content of the preceding context. This effect, which we discuss in terms of expectations/lexico-syntactic priming, suggests that the enhancement of the extraction effect in supportive contexts is due to the facilitation of the subject-extracted condition.},

abstract = {The practice of science has changed in the last three decades due to the rapid development of information and communication technologies and massive increases in computing capacity, made manifest by the Internet. As the International Council for Science (ICSU) describes in its recently released five-year strategic plan, there is now more scientific data and information that is freely and openly available. This environment enables scientists around the world access to the most up-to-date data and information from his or her desktop. ldquoSecondary analyses of data, and the combining of data from multiple sources, are opening up exciting new scientific horizons. Scientific publication practices are changing rapidly.rdquo (ICSU, 2005, 16-17) These revolutionary changes in the creation, management, and use of scientific data and information have significant economic and social implications. First among them are the economic and legal aspects provoked by open sharing versus intellectual property protection of scientific data. In addition to the impact of these issues, there are technical challenges in managing the life cycle of scientific data. Long-term preservation strategies are evolving to ensure that the authenticity of scientific data can be verified, and to enable knowledge discovery and interoperability via metadata representations of the data collections.To maximize the impact of scientific data, the information community needs to promote new thinking and structures in society to properly collect, preserve and distribute this resource. In response to the issues and challenges in access to scientific data and information, we have arranged for a comprehensive session that examines the topic from a holistic view. For full coverage, two panels are required: one that covers the current social and policy contexts and one that covers the system developments being driven by these broader issues. The experts on both panels will contribute their experience from conducting social, economic, and technical research of scientific data and information and invite the ASIS\&T annual meeting attendees to join them in discussion.},

abstract = {Understanding a sentence requires a working memory of the partial products of comprehension, so that linguistic relations between temporally distal parts of the sentence can be rapidly computed. We describe an emerging theoretical framework for this working memory system that incorporates several independently motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order) information subject to interference from similar items, and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational model embodying these principles provides an explanation of the functional capacities and severe limitations of human processing, as well as accounts of reading times. The broad implication is that the detailed nature of cross-linguistic sentence processing emerges from the interaction of general principles of human memory with the specialized task of language comprehension.},

However, the "effective preparation period" may be longer than FP: nonspecific preparation may start prior to FP (e.g., at the onset of S1) and/or continue after it (i.e., in parallel with the reaction process). In four experiments, we factorially varied FP and an additional factor (S1-duration; S2-luminance; stimulus-response compatibility) that probed the effective preparation period outside the bounds of FP. By examining how equivalent RT-FP functions obtain at the different levels of the additional factor, we showed that nonspecific preparation (1) starts at the onset of S1 for brief FPs but at its offset for longer FPs and (2) continues in parallel with S2-encoding but stops prior to response selection.},

The displays are designed to produce a perceptual interpretation of the target as a new state of an object that previously contained one of the primes. The link is produced in different experiments by a shared location, by a shared relative position in a moving pattern, or by successive appearance in the same moving frame. An object-specific advantage is consistently observed: naming is facilitated by a preview of the target, if (and in some cases only if) the two appearances are linked to the same object. The amount and the object specificity of the preview benefit are not affected by extending the preview duration to 1 s, or by extending the temporal gap between fields to 590 ms. The results are interpreted in terms of a reviewing process, which is triggered by the appearance of the target and retrieves just one of the previewed items. In the absence of an object link, the reviewing item is selected at random. We develop the concept of an object file as a temporary episodic representation, within which successive states of an object are linked and integrated.},

abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an
increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the
word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions
have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers’ efforts
to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the
Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., \& Rayner, K. (1982).
Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements
in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology,
14, 178–210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection
of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative
to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out
hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic
operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis
of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point
from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking
experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of
these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically
identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision,
that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word
was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment
2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the
display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the
results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall
distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects
being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted
as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with
fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained,
partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of
linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing
computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

We evaluate 49 obesity-related genome-wide experiments with publicly available findings including microarray, genetics, proteomics and gene knock-down from human, mouse, rat and worm, in terms of their ability to rediscover a comprehensive set of genes previously found to be causally associated or having variants associated with obesity. RESULTS: Individual experiments show poor predictive ability for rediscovering known obesity-associated genes. We show that intersecting the results of experiments significantly improves the sensitivity, specificity and precision of the prediction of obesity-associated genes. We create an integrative model that statistically significantly outperforms all 49 individual genome-wide experiments. We find that genes known to be associated with obesity are significantly implicated in more obesity-related experiments and use this to provide a list of genes that we predict to have the highest likelihood of association for obesity. The approach described here can include any number and type of genome-wide experiments and might be useful for other complex polygenic disorders as well.},

non-linear integro-differential equations. By analyzing the equations,
we obtain the equilibrium solution of topographic connections. It
is also proved that a part of the presynaptic field which is frequently
stimulated comes to be mapped on a large area of the postsynaptic
field so that it has a good resolution.},

An analysis of the archived data suggests that the scalar property (a form of Weber's law) applies to timed performance of a chimpanzee in orbit of the earth. Challenges associated with data archives are discussed. Although significant challenges are associated with archiving electronic data, these difficulties are outweighed by its merits.},

abstract = {A large, single-frame, visual-memory search experiment is reported in which memory and display loads of 1, 2, and 4 alphanumeric characters were factorially combined. In addition to the usual Consistent Mapping and Varied Mapping conditions, the experiment also involved a Categorical Varied Mapping condition in which different sets of stimuli switched roles as targets and distractors over trials. The stimuli used in these various mapping conditions were either digits, letters, or digits and letters. Analyses of the response time means obtained early and late in training suggest that the presence of categorical distinctions among the stimuli is the most important determinant of search efficiency. Comparison of the load effects on the response time means and on their standard deviations revealed a fairly constant ratio throughout the experimental conditions, which suggests that similar search processes may have been involved. A feature-based comparison model is indeed shown to account for the response time means obtained after extensive training under just about all training conditions, as well as for the ratios of load effects on means and standard deviations. According to the model, improvement in search efficiency results from a reduction in the number of features considered. The model's performance questions the necessity to postulate qualitative differences between controlled and automatic processing, while the experiment forces a reassessment of the importance of the consistent mapping that underlies dual-process theories.},

abstract = {Language comprehension requires recovering meaning from linguistic form, even when the mapping between the two is indirect. A canonical example is ellipsis, the omission of information that is subsequently understood without being overtly pronounced. Comprehension of ellipsis requires retrieval of an antecedent from memory, without prior prediction, a property which enables the study of retrieval in situ (Martin \& McElree, 2008, 2009). Sluicing, or inflectional phrase ellipsis, in the presence of a conjunction, presents a test case where a competing antecedent position is syntactically licensed, in contrast with most cases of nonadjacent dependency, including verb phrase ellipsis. We present speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-movement data inconsistent with the hypothesis that retrieval is accomplished via a syntactically guided search, a particular variant of search not examined in past research. The observed timecourse profiles are consistent with the hypothesis that antecedents are retrieved via a cue-dependent direct-access mechanism susceptible to general memory variables.},

abstract = {In two experiments, we explored the use of event-related brain potentials to selectively track the processes that establish reference during spoken language comprehension. Subjects listened to stories in which a particular noun phrase like "the girl" either uniquely referred to a single referent mentioned in the earlier discourse, or ambiguously referred to two equally suitable referents. Referentially ambiguous nouns ("the girl" with two girls introduced in the discourse context) elicited a frontally dominant and sustained negative shift in brain potentials, emerging within 300-400 ms after acoustic noun onset. The early onset of this effect reveals that reference to a discourse entity can be established very rapidly. Its morphology and distribution suggest that at least some of the processing consequences of referential ambiguity may involve an increased demand on memory resources. Furthermore, because this referentially induced ERP effect is very different from that of well-known ERP effects associated with the semantic (N400) and syntactic (e.g., P600/SPS) aspects of language comprehension, it suggests that ERPs can be used to selectively keep track of three major processes involved in the comprehension of an unfolding piece of discourse.},

In addition, the manipulation utilized either a high or low frequency word in word n + 1 location on the assumption that it would be more likely that n + 2 preview effects could be obtained when word n + 1 was high frequency. The primary findings were that there was no evidence for a preview benefit for word n + 2 and no evidence for parafoveal-on-foveal effects when word n + 1 is at least four letters long.

According to most cognitive models of spoken word recognition, this complexity is dealt with before lexical access via a process of abstraction from the acoustic signal to pre-lexical categories. It is currently unclear how these categories are implemented in the auditory cortex. Recent advances in animal neurophysiology and human functional imaging have made it possible to investigate the processing of speech in terms of probabilistic cortical maps rather than simple cognitive subtraction, which will enable us to relate neurometric data more directly to behavioural studies. We suggest that integration of insights from cognitive science, neurophysiology and functional imaging is necessary for furthering our understanding of pre-lexical abstraction in the cortex.},

In any individual research article, several tens of gigabytes-worth of data may be represented-collected across normal and patient samples. With the ease of collecting such data, there is increased desire for brain imaging datasets to be openly shared through sophisticated databases. However, very often the raw and pre-processed versions of these data are not available to researchers outside of the team that collected them. A range of neuroimaging databasing approaches has streamlined the transmission, storage, and dissemination of data from such brain imaging studies. Though early sociological and technical concerns have been addressed, they have not been ameliorated altogether for many in the field. In this article, we review the progress made in neuroimaging databases, their role in data sharing, data management, potential for the construction of brain atlases, recording data provenance, and value for re-analysis, new publication, and training. We feature the LONI IDA as an example of an archive being used as a source for brain atlas workflow construction, list several instances of other successful uses of image databases, and comment on archive sustainability. Finally, we suggest that, given these developments, now is the time for the neuroimaging community to re-prioritize large-scale databases as a valuable component of brain imaging science.},

In such models, the first passage time for the diffusion process through a response criterion determines the time at which an observer makes a decision about the identity of a stimulus. Because the assumptions of many cognitive models lead to SDEs that are time inhomogeneous, classical methods for solving such first passage time problems are usually inapplicable. In contrast, recent integral equation methods often yield solutions to both the one-sided and the two-sided first passage time problems, even in the presence of time inhomogeneity. These methods, which are of particular relevance to the cognitive modeler, are described in detail, together with illustrative applications. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

On the basis of data from the ICE-GB corpus, I analyze two different pairs of syntactic patterns, the so-called dative alternation and particle placement of transitive phrasal verbs. Although it has sometimes been argued that only experimental data can contribute to studies of priming, the analysis shows that (a) the corpus-based results for datives are very similar to the experimental ones; (b) priming is also obtained for the verb-particle construction, a construction hitherto not explored in the priming literature and (c), most importantly, in line with much previous psycholinguistic and corpus-linguistic work, priming effects turn out to be strongly verb-specific such that some verbs are much more resistant or responsive to priming than others. I conclude with a discussion of how corpus data relate to experimental data and how the corpus-based findings can contribute to psycholinguistic model building.},

abstract = {Model selection should be based not solely on goodness-of-fit, but must also consider model complexity. While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental process, choosing the model that best fits a particular set of data will not achieve this goal. This is because a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process. It is shown that model selection based solely on the fit to observed data will result in the choice of an unnecessarily complex model that overfits the data, and thus generalizes poorly. The effect of over-fitting must be properly offset by model selection methods. An application example of selection methods using artificial data is also presented. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {We report two experiments which examined the role of binding theory in on-line sentence processing. Participants’ eye movements were recorded while they read short texts which included anaphoric references with reflexive anaphors (himself or herself). In each of the experiments, two characters were introduced into the discourse before the anaphor, and only one of these characters was a grammatical antecedent for the anaphor in terms of binding theory. Both experiments showed that Principle A of the binding theory operates at the very earliest stages of processing; early eye-movement measures showed evidence of processing difficulty when the gender of the reflexive anaphor mismatched the stereotypical gender of the grammatical antecedent. However, the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent had no effect on early processing, although it affected processing during later stages in Experiment 1. An additional experiment showed that the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent also affected the likelihood of participants settling on an ungrammatical final interpretation. The results are interpreted in relation to the notions of bonding and resolution in reference processing.},

abstract = {An ideal experiment is one in which data collection is efficient and the results are maximally informative. This standard can be difficult to achieve because of uncertainties about the consequences of design decisions. We demonstrate the success of a Bayesian adaptive method (adaptive design optimization, ADO) in optimizing design decisions when comparing models of the time course of forgetting. Across a series of testing stages, ADO intelligently adapts the retention interval in order to maximally discriminate power and exponential models. Compared with two different control (non-adaptive) methods, ADO distinguishes the models decisively, with the results unambiguously favoring the power model. Analyses suggest that ADO's success is due in part to its flexibility in adjusting to individual differences. This implementation of ADO serves as an important first step in assessing its applicability and usefulness to psychology.},

@article{Mathys2011b,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The 1980s marked the occasion when Geographical Information System (GIS) technology was broadly introduced into the geo-spatial community through the establishment of a strong GIS industry. This technology quickly disseminated across many countries, and has now become established as an important research, planning and commercial tool for a wider community that includes organisations in the public and private health sectors. The broad acceptance of GIS technology and the nature of its functionality have meant that numerous datasets have been created over the past three decades. Most of these datasets have been created independently, and without any structured documentation systems in place. However, search and retrieval systems can only work if there is a mechanism for datasets existence to be discovered and this is where proper metadata creation and management can greatly help. This situation must be addressed through support mechanisms such as Web-based portal technologies, metadata editor tools, automation, metadata standards and guidelines and collaborative efforts with relevant individuals and organisations. Engagement with data developers or administrators should also include a strategy of identifying the benefits associated with metadata creation and publication. FINDINGS: The establishment of numerous Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), and other Internet resources, is a testament to the recognition of the importance of supporting good data management and sharing practices across the geographic information community. These resources extend to health informatics in support of research, public services and teaching and learning. This paper identifies many of these resources available to the UK academic health informatics community. It also reveals the reluctance of many spatial data creators across the wider UK academic community to use these resources to create and publish metadata, or deposit their data in repositories for sharing. The Go-Geo! service is introduced as an SDI developed to provide UK academia with the necessary resources to address the concerns surrounding metadata creation and data sharing. The Go-Geo! portal, Geodoc metadata editor tool, ShareGeo spatial data repository, and a range of other support resources, are described in detail. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a variety of resources available for the health research and public health sector to use for managing and sharing their data. The Go-Geo! service is one resource which offers an SDI for the eclectic range of disciplines using GIS in UK academia, including health informatics. The benefits of data management and sharing are immense, and in these times of cost restraints, these resources can be seen as solutions to find cost savings which can be reinvested in more research.},

Older participants had reduced working-memory spans compared with younger participants. The on-line measures were sensitive to local increases in processing load, and the off-line measures were sensitive to the syntactic complexity of the sentences. Older and younger participants showed similar effects of syntactic complexity on the on-line measures. There was some evidence that older participants were more affected than younger participants by syntactic complexity on the off-line measures. The results support the hypothesis that on-line processes involved in recognizing linguistic forms and determining the literal, preferred, discourse-coherent meaning of sentences constitute a domain of language processing that relies on its own processing resource or working-memory system.},

- SAT/ET: "The data indicate that the complexity of the noun phrase in the VP antecedent had no measurable effects on either the speed or the accuracy of processing the VP ellipsis. This is again consistent with a pointer mech- anism but is inconsistent with a copy process."
> Would argument really be part of the copy process?

        
EXP 5:
- SAT

        
GENERAL
- Decay (Gibson and colleagues) might be an alternative explanation, but there is ample evidence against it from research on working memory
- "We found that longer distances between the antecedent and the ellipsis site did not affect reading time at either the ellipsis site or the spillover region. This pattern is inconsistent with a search mechanism, in that one would expect slower times at these regions if more time was required to search for a remote antecedent."
- same pattern as in filler-gap constructions, where occurence of a to-be-resolved dependency can be predicted > general mechanism
- "Collectively, our experiments indicate that the ante- cedent for a VP ellipsis can be accessed in memory with- out a search through other representations formed before encountering the ellipsis, and that interpretation of an ellipsis can be accomplished without copying the contents of the antecedent into the ellipsis site."

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping have accelerated the creation of pharmacogenomic data. Consequently, the community requires standard formats to exchange large amounts of diverse information. To facilitate the transfer of pharmacogenomics data between databases and analysis packages, we have created a standard XML (eXtensible Markup Language) schema that describes both genotype and phenotype data as well as associated metadata. The schema accommodates information regarding genes, drugs, diseases, experimental methods, genomic/RNA/protein sequences, subjects, subject groups, and literature. The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB; www.pharmgkb.org) has used this XML schema for more than 5 years to accept and process submissions containing more than 1,814,139 SNPs on 20,797 subjects using 8,975 assays. Although developed in the context of pharmacogenomics, the schema is of general utility for exchange of genotype and phenotype data. We have written syntactic and semantic validators to check documents using this format.

abstract = {Many concerns would find it useful to have a publicly available database recording exposures to particular substances, with contextual information. The European Union's Registration, Evaluations, Authorisation, and restriction of Chemicals regulation has increased interest in this. It has been suggested that journals should require detailed publication of exposure data with papers. But there are problems for researchers, for whom the data are a valuable resource which has been obtained with effort and often ingenuity. The publication could also raise problems of confidentiality and liability, and those who have to put the effort in publication are not those who benefit. Also, there are the problems of hostile critics misusing the information--for example, industry re-analysing data to counter any regulatory implications of a study--and this raises serious wider issues of editorial policy. Two books have recently given examples of industry misuse of science, 'Doubt is their product' by David Michaels and 'Defending the indefensible' by McCullogh and Tweedale. Michaels gives examples of hostile data reanalysis, and among other things, he discusses the impact on journals of US Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which encourages expert witnesses to try to get their testimony material into peer-reviewed journals. This certainly lies behind some submissions to this journal, and Michaels says that it has led to the creation of peer-reviewed journals which have strong industry influence. On the other hand, work funded by industry is not always wrong, papers from other sources are not always free from bias, and the problem for journals is to continue to apply consistent scientific standards in a sea of conflicting interests. It does not seem feasible or desirable for journals to insist on the publication of all the underlying data, although researchers might be encouraged to form consortia to share data.},

Results of the tests of these hypotheses suggest that process architecture and the stopping rule do not distinguish the processing of meaningful and meaningless forms. The major distinction between configural and nonconfigural processing was with regard to processing capacity, potentially implicating channel interdependencies.

Currently, these data are somewhat problematic, primarily with regard to geographic and taxonomic accuracy, for use in ecological research, natural resources management and conservation decision-making. However, web-based georeferencing tools that utilize best practices and gazetteer databases can be employed to improve geographic data. Taxonomic data quality can be improved through web-enabled valid taxon names databases and services, as well as more efficient mechanisms to return systematic research results and taxonomic misidentification rates back to the biodiversity community. Both of these are under construction. A separate but related challenge will be developing web-based visualization and analysis tools for tracking biodiversity change. Our aim was to discuss how such tools, combined with data of enhanced quality, will help transform today's portals to raw biodiversity data into nexuses of collaborative creation and sharing of biodiversity knowledge.},

Recently published meta-analyses show that several important areas of research on infectious diseases lack sufficient randomized evidence. Often evidence is scattered across a large number of small trials, making meta-analysis a promising way to integrate diverse results. Quality of trials in the field is often poor. There are several examples where evidence was accumulated primarily for marketing rather than for scientific purposes. Finally, meta-analyses are also raising the problem of what constitutes clinically significant treatment benefits, as well as interesting issues about the reproducibility of clinical evidence and its evolving nature.

cortical areas MT (V5) and MST were the first areas of the 'dorsal'

intensity to apparent motion stimuli as compared with flickering

contours evoked greater activation in V2 and MT/MST than appropriate
control conditions. Several areas of the dorsal pathway (V3A, MT/MST,
areas in the inferior and superior parietal lobule) as well as prefrontal
areas including FEF and BA 9/46 responded strongly when subjects
merely imagined moving stimuli which they had seen several seconds
before. The activation during motion imagery increased with the synaptic
distance of an area from V1 along the dorsal processing stream. Area
MT/MST was selectively activated during motion imagery but not during
a static imagery control condition. The comparison between the results
obtained with objective motion, apparent motion and imagined motion
provides further insights into a complex cortical network of motion-sensitive

abstract = {R. Ratcliff, P. Gomez, and G. McKoon (2004) suggested much of what goes on in lexical decision is attributable to decision processes and may not be particularly informative about word recognition. They proposed that lexical decision should be characterized by a decision process, taking the form of a drift-diffusion model (R. Ratcliff, 1978), that operates on the output of lexical model. The present article argues that the distinction between perception and decision making is unnecessary and that it is possible to give a unified account of both lexical processing and decision making. This claim is supported by formal arguments and reinforced by simulations showing how the Bayesian Reader model (D. Norris, 2006) can be extended to fit the data on reaction time distributions collected by Ratcliff, Gomez, and McKoon simply by adding extra sources of noise. The Bayesian Reader gives an integrated explanation of both word recognition and decision making, using fewer parameters than the diffusion model. It can be thought of as a Bayesian diffusion model, which subsumes Ratcliff's drift-diffusion model as a special case.},

abstract = {To examine the nature of the information that guides eye movements to previously read text during reading (regressions), we used a relatively novel technique to request a regression to a particular target word when the eyes reached a predefined location during sentence reading. A regression was to be directed to a close or a distant target when either the first or the second line of a complex two-line sentence was read. In addition, conditions were created that pitted effects of spatial and linguistic distance against each other. Initial regressions were more accurate when the target was spatially near, and effects of spatial distance dominated effects of verbal distance. Initial regressions rarely moved the eyes onto the target, however, and subsequent “corrective” regressions that homed in on the target were subject to general linguistic processing demands, being more accurate during firstline reading than during second-line reading. The results suggest that spatial and verbal memory guide regressions in reading. Initial regressions are primarily guided by fixation-centered spatial memory, and corrective regressions are primarily guided by linguistic knowledge.},

Similar results, but regressions were quite imprecise, and precision was less accurate when the distance was longer. Again the data is compatible with coarse spatial info or location reconstruction based on verbal info.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 1:
Gaze-contingent speech-technique: Participants hear an already read word
while reading a follow-up word. They have to move their gaze back to the word the hear. Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. 

        

        
In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated.
Conditions:
* Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line)

        

        
PREDICTIONS:
(Very questionable predictions)
* If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit.
They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects.

Regressions do not produce the experience of a "word salad", even though the temporal order of words is mixed up. Readers are often not even aware of having regressed.
-> Inconsistencies between temporal and spatial word order need to be resolved. [Or: Temporal order needs to be ignored while spatial order is perceived.]

        

        
Kennedy et al. (2003): Exp
Readers were asked a question about a sentence which either remained on the screen durng the question or not. In 13\% and 50\% of the trials respectively, readers regressed *toward* the relevant word.
In both conditions, *if* a regression was executed, the eyes moved ver close to the target word. 
[I hope this does not mean that they re-read the sentence]
=> Readers have a spatial memory for words. But could be verbal, too.

        

        
Inhoff \{\&\} Weger (2005):
Similar results, but regressions were quite imprecise, and precision was less accurate when the distance was longer. Again the data is compatible with coarse spatial info or location reconstruction based on verbal info.

        

        
EXPERIMENT 1:
Gaze-contingent speech-technique: Participants hear an already read word
while reading a follow-up word. They have to move their gaze back to the word the hear. Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. 

        

        
In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated.
Conditions:
* Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line)

        

        
PREDICTIONS:
(Very questionable predictions)
* If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit.
They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects.
[I guess I agree with the general idea of storage=spatial vs. reconstruction=verbal. Higher load+reconstruction should really lead to worse performance.]

        

        

        

        
In another half of the conditions [Subexp 2], regressions were started from the beginning of the second line. Verbal and spatial distance were dissociated, or rather always mismatched. Sometimes the first line was masked with random characters, before the probe was presented.
Conditons:
* spatial close, verbal far \{\&\} spatial far, verbal close x mask/no mask

        

        

        

        
RESULTS:
- Measures of interest: Regression size and (absolute) accuracy.

        

        
Regression Size:
* Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance (longer saccades with increasing distance), but no effect of line and no interaction.
* Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, and interaction between distance and line. The interaction is caused by a larger effect of distance in the first line.
==> No effect in initial but then an effect in cumulative size. 
According to W\{\&\}I there is spatial adressing, but then finer verbal 
guidance.

        

        
Regression Accuracy:
* Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance, and marginal main effect of line: Accuracy slightly higher in first line than second line (p=.08). No interaction.
* Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, main effect of line (better accuracy in first line.) No interaction.

abstract = {People comprehend utterances rapidly and without conscious effort. Traditional theories assume that sentence processing is algorithmic and that meaning is derived compositionally. The language processor is believed to generate representations of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate. However, recent findings challenge these assumptions. Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. Our good-enough approach to language comprehension holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough.},

Later this year, the NSF will start requiring scientists seeking research grants to include a data-management plan in their applications, describing how and when their data will be shared.

affect reading performance: first, whether a stimulus is a word or
pronounceable non-word (lexicality), second, how often a word is
encountered (frequency), and third, whether the pronunciation has
a predictable spelling-to-sound correspondence (consistency). Comparisons
between word naming (reading) and visual fixation scans revealed
stimulus-related activation differences in seven regions. A left
frontal region showed effects of consistency and lexicality, indicating
a role in orthographic to phonological transformation. Motor cortex
showed an effect of consistency bilaterally, suggesting that motoric
processes beyond high-level representations of word phonology influence
reading performance. Implications for the integration of these results
into theoretical models of word reading are discussed.},

a regression-contingent analysis in eye movement studies dealing
with parsing of sentences containing temporary structural ambiguities.
Using experimental sentences preceded by referentially supportive
contexts, they demonstrated a different pattern of results when regressive
eye movements were eliminated from the data set than when regressions
were included. The regression-contingent analysis that they used
involves an implicit assumption that regressive eye movements are
a necessary consequence of subjects' being garden pathed. We report
some data which demonstrate that garden path effects are sometimes
even stronger in the absence of regressions and, thus, argue that
readers can be garden pathed without making regressions.},

abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

abstract = {We report three eye-movement experiments that investigated whether alternative syntactic analyses compete during syntactic ambiguity resolution. Previous research (Traxler, Pickering, \& Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, \& Traxler, 2001) has shown that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences, suggesting that competition does not explain processing difficulty. However, the disambiguation in these studies was delayed relative to the initial point of ambiguity, so they do not rule out models which claim that competition is very short-lasting. The current experiments show that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences even when the disambiguation is immediate. Furthermore, globally ambiguous sentences are no harder to process than syntactically unambiguous sentences. We argue that the results are inconsistent with currently implemented constraint-based competition models, and support variable-choice reanalysis models such as the unrestricted race model.},

abstract = {Some people are better readers than others, and this variation in comprehension ability is predicted by measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The primary goal of this study was to investigate the mediating role of mind-wandering experiences in the association between WMC and normal individual differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by the executive-attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle \& Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable, structural-equation-model approach, testing skilled adult readers on 3 WMC span tasks, 7 varied reading-comprehension tasks, and 3 attention-control tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using experimenter-scheduled thought probes during 4 different tasks (2 reading, 2 attention-control). The results support the executive-attention theory of WMC. Mind wandering across the 4 tasks loaded onto a single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual difference. Most important, mind wandering was a significant mediator in the relationship between WMC and reading comprehension, suggesting that the WMC–comprehension correlation is driven, in part, by attention control over intruding thoughts. We discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention control, and reading comprehension. },

However, techniques for fitting distributions vary widely, and little is known about the efficacy of different techniques. In this article, we assess several fitting techniques by simulating six widely cited models of response time and using the fitting procedures to recover model parameters. The techniques include the maximization of likelihood and least squares fits of the theoretical distributions to different empirical estimates of the simulated dis- tributions. A running example is used to illustrate the different estimation and fitting procedures. The sim- ulation studies reveal that empirical density estimates are biased even for very large sample sizes. Some fitting techniques yield more accurate and less variable parameter estimates than do others. Methods that involve least squares fits to density estimates generally yield very poor parameter estimates.},

The traditional practice has been to contribute experimental and observational data to the commons when, or shortly after, the analysis of that data is published, sometimes years after its initial collection ( 3, 4). Because of busy schedules, competitive pressures, and other interpersonal vagaries, the sharing of scientifi c data can be inconsistent even after publication ( 5, 6).

In the reading studies, syntactic misanalysis effects in sentence complements (e.g., "The student forgot the solution was...") occurred at the verb in the complement (e.g., was) for matrix verbs typically used with noun phrase complements but not for verbs typically used with sentence complements. In addition, a complementizer effect for sentence-complement-biased verbs was not due to syntactic misanalysis but was correlated with how strongly a particular verb prefers to be followed by the complementizer that. The results support models that make immediate use of lexically specific constraints, especially constraint-based models, but are problematic for lexical filtering models.},

abstract = {Most models of response time (RT) in elementary cognitive tasks implicitly assume that the speed-accuracy trade-off is continuous: When payoffs or instructions gradually increase the level of speed stress, people are assumed to gradually sacrifice response accuracy in exchange for gradual increases in response speed. This trade-off presumably operates over the entire range from accurate but slow responding to fast but chance-level responding (i.e., guessing). In this article, we challenge the assumption of continuity and propose a phase transition model for RTs and accuracy. Analogous to the fast guess model (Ollman, 1966), our model postulates two modes of processing: a guess mode and a stimulus-controlled mode. From catastrophe theory, we derive two important predictions that allow us to test our model against the fast guess model and against the popular class of sequential sampling models. The first prediction--hysteresis in the transitions between guessing and stimulus-controlled behavior--was confirmed in an experiment that gradually changed the reward for speed versus accuracy. The second prediction--bimodal RT distributions--was confirmed in an experiment that required participants to respond in a way that is intermediate between guessing and accurate responding.},

In this article we propose an approach to automating eye-movement

tracing methods that provide fast and robust analysis and alleviate
the equipment noise and individual variability prevalent in typical

abstract = {One-choice reaction-time (RT) tasks are used in many domains, including assessments of motor vehicle driving and assessments of the cognitive/behavioral consequences of sleep deprivation. In such tasks, subjects are asked to respond when they detect the onset of a stimulus; the dependent variable is RT. We present a cognitive model for one-choice RT tasks that uses a one-boundary diffusion process to represent the accumulation of stimulus information. When the accumulated evidence reaches a decision criterion, a response is initiated. This model is distinct in accounting for the RT distributions observed for one-choice RT tasks, which can have long tails that have not been accurately captured by earlier cognitive modeling approaches. We show that the model explains performance on a brightness-detection task (a "simple RT task") and on a psychomotor vigilance test. The latter is used extensively to examine the clinical and behavioral effects of sleep deprivation. For the brightness-detection task, the model explains the behavior of RT distributions as a function of brightness. For the psychomotor vigilance test, it accounts for lapses in performance under conditions of sleep deprivation and for changes in the shapes of RT distributions over the course of sleep deprivation. The model also successfully maps the rate of accumulation of stimulus information onto independently derived predictions of alertness. The model is a unified, mechanistic account of one-choice RT under conditions of sleep deprivation.},

@article{Lundh2011,
abstract = {The importance of transparency and data sharing in clinical research is increasingly emphasised, and public funders increasingly require that all data from publicly sponsored research are made available.1 The same cannot be said for industry-sponsored trials, for which the sponsors often own the data and the academic authors have limited publication rights.2
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recommends that authors declare that they had full access to all of the data.2 However, the definition of “data” is open to interpretation. It should mean all raw data, including those written on case report forms (CRFs), to enable independent coding of events and data analysis. But it could also mean tabulated, processed data in clinical study reports, for which the sponsor has already interpreted the events and done imputations for missing data. We investigated what types of data academic authors had access to in industry-sponsored trials published in The Lancet and how they used them.
Using PubMed, we identified 169 randomised clinical trials published in The Lancet in 2008—09 and included the 69 (41\%) that were industry-sponsored. The editors provided us with the protocols, except in seven cases where the full protocols were missing and were obtained from the authors or sponsors. We categorised data ownership and access on the basis of information in protocols and papers.
We contacted the corresponding author of each trial, apart from six trials where this author was sponsor-employed and where we contacted the academic author who seemed to have been most involved with data analysis. Using a pilot-tested questionnaire, we asked about the type of data access: CRFs; data file with raw data identical to information in CRFs; data file with processed data (eg, nausea and constipation coded as gastrointestinal complaints); or clinical study report. We also asked whether they used this access, and if so, how. To improve response rates, we contacted authors by repeated emails, letter, and telephone.
Finally, using repeated emails we asked the Lancet editors handling clinical trials which type of data they regarded as mandatory when corresponding authors declared “full access to all the data”.
27 of the 69 protocols described that the sponsor owned the data. In 67 protocols, there was no information on academic authors' access to data, in striking contrast to the papers, which indicated that one or more academic authors had access to the data in 64 trials. These data meant “full access” in 62 cases, “study results” in one case, and “study report” in one case. In three of the remaining five trials, only the sponsor-employed authors had declared full access, and, in two, access was unclear (the authors had access to summary data only according to the protocol but full access according to the paper).
Survey responses were obtained from 39 academic authors (57\% response rate). In 31 cases, the academic authors reported that they had full or partial access to CRFs, in 31 to raw data, in 33 to processed data, and in 38 to clinical study reports (table). In 27 trials, academic authors had access to both CRFs and to raw data. These replies might have been somewhat optimistic, since it was clear from the survey that some authors interpreted access as having been met if the sponsor would provide data on request.
11 of the 39 academic authors reported that they checked individual CRFs and compared them with the data in the study database. 13 reported that they used raw data, 13 processed data, and 32 clinical study reports, to redo statistical analyses done by the company or to compare data with what was reported in the manuscript. Ten academic authors used only clinical study reports and six did not use any data, although five were corresponding authors and one principal investigator. 18 used some of the data to do additional statistical analyses, which were not part of the protocol.
11 of 18 editors replied to our survey (61\% response rate). Nine editors considered that full access to any CRF on request and access to raw data were mandatory when corresponding authors declared “full access to all the data”.
Our most important finding was the huge discrepancy between the protocols and the papers on access to data. Considering also that the academic authors were somewhat reluctant to respond to our survey, and their liberal interpretation of what it means to have access, our survey results about data access could be far too positive. In support of this possibility, a survey of US academic institutions found that trial agreements rarely ensured that authors had independent access to all trial data.3 Furthermore, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have stated that academic authors should be provided with summary data only.4
Steinbrook and Kassirer5 have highlighted that journals should define what is meant by “full access” to avoid confusion. We suggest that journals require submission of protocols, and any amendments and additional agreements, and the full dataset to ensure that “full access” is more than window dressing. We also believe that raw data should be available to peer reviewers and the public, as some journals require—eg, Science. As an intermediate solution, journals could consider requiring an independent data analysis, as is the case for JAMA.
Most importantly, we should work towards a situation in which anonymised raw data are made freely available to the public.1 Our patients deserve nothing less than this, which would be highly beneficial for health care.
We thank David McNamee and Richard Horton of The Lancet for providing us with copies of trial protocols. We thank the authors and editors for participating in our survey and authors and two companies for providing us with copies of the missing protocols. The study was partly funded by the Health Insurance Foundation and the Danish Council for Independent Research—Medical Sciences, and partly by the Nordic Cochrane Centre. We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.

In a rating study, the gender stereotypes for 405 noun and noun compounds were assessed. From these norms, 32 words strongly stereotyped to refer mostly to males and 32 words strongly stereotyped to refer mostly to females were selected and used in a reading experiment. Comprehenders read pairs of sentences. The subject of the first sentence was a gender stereotyped word (e.g., executive or secretary). The subject of the second sentence was either the pronoun he or she. Reading time was significantly longer when gender of the pronoun mismatched the gender stereotype of the antecedent than when the genders of pronoun and antecedent matched. This gender mismatch effect occurred on the two regions immediately following the region containing the pronoun. The results indicated that word-specific gender stereotypes can influence coreference resolution of pronouns.},

investigated in Experiment 2. Subjects spenta longer time fixating
ambiguous words with two equally likely meanings than fixating ambigu-ous

abstract = {hen participants are asked to respond in the same way to several stimulus identities, responses are often observed to be faster if two stimuli are presented simultaneously as opposed to when a single stimulus is presented (redundant signals effect; Miller, 1982). An important issue of such experiments is whether the observed redundancy gains can be explained by parallel processing of the two stimuli in a race-like fashion. To test the parallel processing model, Miller derived the well-known race model inequality which has become a routine test for behavioral data in experiments with redundant signals. Several statistical procedures have been used for testing the race model inequality. However, the commonly employed procedure does not control the Type I error. In this article a permutation test is described that keeps the Type I error at the desired level. Simulations show that the power of the test is reasonable even for small samples.

To investigate whether this component exclusively reflects attentional target selection or also prior stages in attentional processing (covert orienting, target-unspecific spatial attention), a spatial cuing procedure was combined with a visual search task. In some blocks, informative cues indicated the side of upcoming singleton targets that were present on most trials among uniform distractors. In other blocks, cues were spatially uninformative, and no preparatory shifts of attention were possible. The N2pc in response to targets was unaffected by this manipulation, showing that this component is not associated with attention shifts. Following informative cues, an attenuated N2pc was elicited by uniform nontarget arrays, suggesting that the N2pc may also reflect spatially specific processing of stimulus features at task-relevant locations prior to target selection.},

Previous research has shown that eye movements to objects in the visual environment are locked to linguistic input. More surprisingly, listeners fixate on now-empty regions that had previously been occupied by relevant objects. This 'looking at nothing' phenomenon has been linked to the claim that the visual system constructs sparse representations of the external world and relies on saccades and fixations to extract information in a just-in-time manner. Our model provides a different explanation: based on recent work in visual cognition and memory, it assumes that the visual system creates and stores detailed internal memory representations, and that looking at nothing facilitates retrieval of those representations.},

abstract = {Early and late selection models of attention disagree about whether visual objects are identified before or after selection, with recent evidence of interference from to-be-ignored stimuli favoring late selection over early selection accounts. However, these tests may not have permitted optimal attentional focusing. In 4 experiments subjects identified an attentionally cued target letter embedded among distractors. Only minimal effects of information appearing in to-be-ignored locations were observed. This striking efficiency of selection provides support for early selection theories and calls into question some late selection theories holding that stimuli throughout the display are immediately and fully identified prior to attentional selection. In order to explain the larger pattern of results across a variety of focused- and divided-attention paradigms, a hybrid model is advanced with a flexible locus for visual selection.},

Also, for these participants, foveal load modulated preview benefit regardless of fixation durations on the foveal word. For participants who were aware of the display change, preview benefits occurred regardless of foveal processing difficulty.

The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous dual-task performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g., stop signals), and automaticity.

This suggests the hypothesis that responses to redundant stimuli are speeded partly because both hemispheres are involved in the activation of the response. A simple formal model incorporating this idea is developed and then elaborated to account for additional related findings. Predictions of the latter model are in good qualitative agreement with data from a number of sources, and there is neuroanatomic and psychophysiological support for its underlying structure.},

abstract = {E. N. Dzhafarov and R. Schweickert (1995, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 39, 285-314) developed a mathematical theory for the decomposability of response time (RT) into two component times that are selectively influenced by different factors and are either stochastically independent or perfectly positively stochastically interdependent (in which case they are increasing functions of a common random variable). In this theory, RT is obtained from its component times by means of an associative and commutative operation. For any such operation, there is a decomposition test, a relationship between observable RT distributions that holds if and (under mild constraints) only if the RTs are decomposable by means of this operation. In this paper, we construct a sample-level version of these decomposition tests that serve to determine whether RTs that are represented by finite samples are decomposable by means of a given operation (under a given form of stochastic relationship between component times, independence or perfect positive interdependence). The decision is based on the asymptotic p-values associated with the maximal distance between empirical distribution functions computed by combining in a certain way the RT samples corresponding to different treatments.},

abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

We found that extracting the mean size of sets of circles was easier to combine with tasks requiring distributed or global attention than with tasks requiring focused attention. One explanation may be that extracting the statistical descriptors requires parallel access to all the information in the array. Consistent with this claim, we found an advantage for simultaneous over successive presentation when the total time available was matched. However, the advantage was small; parallel access facilitates statistical processing without being essential. Evidence that statistical processing is automatic when attention is distributed over a display came from the finding that there was no decrement in accuracy relative to single-task performance when mean judgments were made concurrently with another task that required distributed or global attention.},

The theory proposes that both processing and storage are mediated by activation and that the total amount of activation available in working memory varies among individuals. Individual differences in working memory capacity for language can account for qualitative and quantitative differences among college-age adults in several aspects of language comprehension. One aspect is syntactic modularity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits interaction among syntactic and pragmatic information, so that their syntactic processes are not informationally encapsulated. Another aspect is syntactic ambiguity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits them to maintain multiple interpretations. The theory is instantiated as a production system model in which the amount of activation available to the model affects how it adapts to the transient computational and storage demands that occur in comprehension.},

Consequently, good readers have more WM capacity available for the storage of products simply because they have more efficient reading skills.A similar correlation (r = -53) between WM span and the Nelson- Denny, a standardized test of reading com- prehension, was found by Masson and Miller (1983).Daneman and col- leagues argued that the reading span is an index of the WM capacity that is NOT al- located to processing (i.e., reading and comprehending) the individual sentences.Span measures embedded in a processing task other than reading correlated with reading comprehension just as well as did the reading span.neman and Carpenter findings, however, may be that people are good readers be- cause they have a large WM capacity inde- pendent of the task being performed. Good readers may be remembering morenumber of items (digits/words) recalled. The main pur- pose of this pilot study was tnot need to be reading related to lead to a correlation between the span measure and a test of reading comprehension.

The Nelson-Denny correlated significantly with Sentence Word span, r(241) = .37, p .25, MSE = 40.46.

abstract = {Many evaluations of cognitive models rely on data that have been averaged or aggregated across all experimental subjects, and so fail to consider the possibility of important individual differences between subjects. Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we have developed a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models in which different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We evaluate this individual differences approach in a simulation study and show that it is superior in terms of the key modeling goals of prediction and understanding. We also provide two practical demonstrations of the approach, one using the ALCOVE model of category learning with data from four previously analyzed category learning experiments, the other using multidimensional scaling representational models with previously analyzed similarity data for colors. In both demonstrations, meaningful individual differences are found and the psychological models are able to account for this variation through interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

abstract = {Report on the Remediation of Primary Citations of PDB data The original PDB entries have very many incomplete primary citations. Accurate primary citations are key archival data, and they are essential for linking to other databases. Historically, BNL had an archive of the reprints of the primary citations, but they were not complete, although 1000 of those reprints are still valuable as some pre-date PubMed. So far, the three wwPDB members have made efforts to remediate the primary citation information, but they were not complete and were done independently. The purpose of this remediation of the primary citations in PDB data is to examine the current situation of the citation information, to plan a systematic way to correct the information, and to execute the remediation following it. Finally, a new procedure to add the corrected information to the current PDB data was considered.},

abstract = {The Principle A of Chomsky's (1981) Binding Theory requires the reflexive pronoun in a sentence to be bound to its antecedent within its governing category. However, in Chinese sentences with a common structure "P-NP(1)+VP(1)+P-NP(2)+VP(2)+ziji", in which the P-NP stands for personal name and the reflexive ziji (standing for myself, himself, herself, yourself, ourselves etc., depending on context) is at the object position, ziji can refer to either the local subject (P-NP(2), local reference) or the matrix or main subject (P-NP(1), long-distance reference) or both (ambiguous reference), depending on properties of VP(2). This study investigates whether this violation of Principle A comes with processing costs during sentence comprehension. In an event-related potential (ERP) experiment we found that, as compared with the local reference condition, ERP responses to ziji were significantly more positive in the long-distance reference condition. This pattern appeared on both P300 and P600. It is suggested that linking the reflexive with a distant, rather than a local, antecedent during sentence comprehension requires more processing resources. While the P300 effect may reflect the detection of incongruence between the mental representation based on Principle A and the representation based on the processing of local verb, the P600 effect may be associated with a second-pass integration process that links the reflexive with the matrix subject.},

 From Duplicate 2 ( Who is ziji? ERP responses to the Chinese reflexive pronoun during sentence comprehension - Li, X; Zhou, X )

        
In an event-related potential (ERP) experiment we found that, as compared with the local reference condition, ERP responses to ziji were significantly more positive in the longdistance reference condition. This pattern appeared on both P300 and P600.

        
Results showed that the naming latency was shorter for the object-related target than for the subjectrelated word. According to the authors, this difference indicated that ziji tends to be locally bound during sentence comprehension, consistent with Chomsky's Binding Theory.

        
A further experiment conducted by Liu (2009) used the same design and critical stimuli as Gao et al. (2005) but with variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between ziji and the target and with a lexical decision task. It showed that the reaction time was shorter to the object-related target than to the subject-related or the neutral word when the SOA = 0 ms, and was shorter to the subject-related word than to the object-related or the neutral word when the SOA = 160 ms; at the SOA of 370 ms, there was no difference between the subject-related and the object-related words although responses to both types of words were shorter than to the neutral word.

        
Intrusion?

        
Here ziji refers to either the local subject (P-NP2, local reference) or the matrix or main subject (P-NP1, long-distance reference). If the dominance of local binding from Principle A influences the interpretation of ziji in unambiguous reference sentences, we could predict that in the long-distance reference condition, overcoming the local binding dominance and linking ziji with P-NP1 would elicit additional neuro-cognitive processes and/or consume additional processing resources.

        
As far as reflexive is concerned, it has been found that syntactic information plays an important role in referential processing.

        
Osterhout et al. (1995, 1997), for example, examined ERP responses to number or gender mismatch between reflexives and their antecedents in English. The P600 effects were obtained on the mismatching reflexives.

        
Harris et al. (2000) obtained a similar P600 effect for the number mismatch between reflexive and its antecedent (e.g., in ``*John's brothers like himself'').

        
Given Chomsky's Principle A and given the findings in previous behavioral studies (Gao et al., 2005; Liu, 2009), we treated the local reference condition as baseline for ERP comparisons, although the behavioral data reported above might suggest otherwise (see Section 3. Discussion).

        
To understand the theoretical implications of these two effects, we need first to rule out the possibility that these effects reflect processing costs associated merely with the distance between ziji and its antecedent (and the associated memory load), rather than with the syntactic structure of the sentence or Chomsky's Principle A.

        
Streb et al. (2004) varied the distance between a proper name and the pronoun by changing the number of intervening sentences. A N400 effect in the 360--480 ms time window was found in the far and medium distance conditions relative to the near distance condition. The authors suggested that this negativity effect reflects the greater demand in working memory on semantic integration or the establishment of co-reference between the pronoun and its antecedent.

        
Therefore, it is unlikely that the positivity effects we observed here reflect the mere distance between the reflexive and it antecedent.

        
Summary P600

        
Given that the participants had free time to reflect upon the possible antecedent of ziji, the difference in accuracy between the two types of sentences should have been reduced or eliminated in the offline test.

        
When inspecting the critical stimuli we notice that most of the sentences with local reference can stand without ziji at the object noun position, i.e., expressing the same meaning with the structure ``P-NP1 + VP1 + P-NP2 + VP2''. It is possible that adding ziji as the object of VP2 could actually hinder the comprehension of the sentence and the acceptability judgment.

        
We suggest that the P300 effect and the P600 effect observed here are associated with specific linguistic functions in sentence comprehension.

        
These findings suggest that although the reflexive ziji can refer to a long-distance antecedent outside its governing category, as usually defined, this violation of Chomsky's Principle A may nevertheless comes with processing costs.

abstract = {We report analytical and computational investigations into the effects of base time on the diagnosticity of two popular theoretical tools in the redundant signals literature: (1) the race model inequality and (2) the capacity coefficient. We show analytically and without distributional assumptions that the presence of base time decreases the sensitivity of both of these measures to model violations. We further use simulations to investigate the statistical power model selection tools based on the race model inequality, both with and without base time. Base time decreases statistical power, and biases the race model test toward conservatism. The magnitude of this biasing effect increases as we increase the proportion of total reaction time variance contributed by base time. We marshal empirical evidence to suggest that the proportion of reaction time variance contributed by base time is relatively small, and that the effects of base time on the diagnosticity of our model-selection tools are therefore likely to be minor. However, uncertainty remains concerning the magnitude and even the definition of base time. Experimentalists should continue to be alert to situations in which base time may contribute a large proportion of the total reaction time variance},

An example of the dynamics is as follows: A fixed size of localized
excitation, once evoked by stimulation, can be retained in the field
persistently even after the stimulation vanishes. It moves until
it finds the position of the maximum of the input stimulus. Fields
consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory layer are next analyzed.
In addition to stationary localized excitation, fields have such
pattern dynamics as production of oscillatory waves, travelling waves,
active and dual active transients, etc.},

@article{Hawkins1990,
abstract = {The mechanism by which visual-spatial attention affects the detection of faint signals has been the subject of considerable debate. It is well known that spatial cuing speeds signal detection. This may imply that attentional cuing modulates the processing of sensory information during detection or, alternatively, that cuing acts to create decision bias favoring input at the cued location. These possibilities were evaluated in 3 spatial cuing experiments. Peripheral cues were used in Experiment 1 and central cues were used in Experiments 2 and 3. Cuing similarly enhanced measured sensitivity, P(A) and d', for simple luminance detection in all 3 experiments. Under some conditions it also induced shifts in decision criteria (beta). These findings indicate that visual-spatial attention facilitates the processing of sensory input during detection either by increasing sensory gain for inputs at cued locations or by prioritizing the processing of cued inputs.},

abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational
models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based
control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency
of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second,
a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus
conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and
plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return,
the process by which the currently attended location is prevented
from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment.
Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational
challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control
attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly
constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these
five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological
understanding of visual attention.},

abstract = {Background: Sharing data is a tenet of science, yet commonplace in only a few subdisciplines. Recognizingthat a data sharing culture is unlikely to be achieved without policy guidance, some funders and journals havebegun to request and require that investigators share their primary datasets with other researchers. The purposeof this study is to understand the current state of data sharing policies within journals, the features of journalsthat are associated with the strength of their data sharing policies, and whether the strength of data sharingpolicies impact the observed prevalence of data sharing. Methods: We investigated these relationships withrespect to gene expression microarray data in the journals that most often publish studies about this type of data.We measured data sharing prevalence as the proportion of papers with submission links from NCBI's GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO) database. We conducted univariate and linear multivariate regressions tounderstand the relationship between the strength of data sharing policy and journal impact factor, journalsubdiscipline, journal publisher (academic societies vs. commercial), and publishing model (open vs. closedaccess). Results: Of the 70 journal policies, 53 made some mention of sharing publication-related data withintheir Instruction to Author statements. Of the 40 policies with a data sharing policy applicable to geneexpression microarrays, we classified 17 as weak and 23 as strong (strong policies required an accession numberfrom database submission prior to publication). Existence of a data sharing policy was associated with the typeof journal publisher: 46\% of commercial journals had data sharing policy, compared to 82\% of journalspublished by an academic society. All five of the open-access journals had a data sharing policy. Policystrength was associated with impact factor: the journals with no data sharing policy, a weak policy, and a strongpolicy had respective median impact factors of 3.6, 4.9, and 6.2. Policy strength was positively associated withmeasured data sharing submission into the GEO database: the journals with no data sharing policy, a weakpolicy, and a strong policy had median data sharing prevalence of 8\%, 20\%, and 25\%, respectively.Conclusion: This review and analysis begins to quantify the relationship between journal policies and datasharing outcomes. We hope it contributes to assessing the incentives and initiatives designed to facilitatewidespread, responsible, effective data sharing.},

Multilevel modeling is commonly utilized to model variability arising from the nesting of lower level observations within higher level units (e.g., students within schools, repeated measures within individuals). However, multilevel models can also be used when two random factors are crossed at the same level, rather than nested. The current work illustrates the use of the multilevel model for crossed random effects within the context of a psycholinguistic experimental study, in which both subjects and items are modeled as random effects within the same analysis, thus avoiding some of the problems plaguing current approaches.},

Our demonstration does, however, assume other linguistic knowledge; thus, we reduce the problem of learning anaphoric one to that of learning this other knowledge. We discuss whether this other knowledge may itself be acquired without linguistic constraints.},

Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited.

Then, we present some recent developments on a new entropic or information complexity (ICOMP) criterion of Bozdogan (1988a, 1988b, 1990, 1994d, 1996, 1998a, 1998b) for model selection. A rationale for ICOMP as a model selection criterion is that it combines a badness-of-fit term (such as minus twice the maximum log likelihood) with a measure of complexity of a model differently than AIC, or its variants, by taking into account the interdependencies of the parameter estimates as well as the dependencies of the model residuals. We operationalize the general form of ICOMP based on the quantification of the concept of overall model complexity in terms of the estimated inverse-Fisher information matrix. This approach results in an approximation to the sum of two Kullback-Leibler distances. Using the correlational form of the complexity, we further provide yet another form of ICOMP to take into account the interdependencies (i.e., correlations) among the parameter estimates of the model. Later, we illustrate the practical utility and the importance of this new model selection criterion by providing several real as well as Monte Carlo simulation examples and compare its performance against AIC, or its variants.

New method of studying *stages* in information processing, (a) without the limitations of Donders and (b) with the posssibility of *discovering* stages, (c) assess of these stages' properties, (d) testing of additivity and stochastic independence of their durations

        

        
DONDERS' METHOD
- strictly serial stages (i.e. additive) and stochastically independent
- elimination of stages: subtraction method
[Example?]

        

        
PROBLEMS WITH DONDERS' METHOD
- Deletion of stages may not (always) be possible. Substitution is more like it.
- We don't know whether they are:
* additive
* stochastically independent

        

        
Assumptions of Sternberg's method
PROPERTIES OF DONDERS' METHOD
- does not measure stage durations
- establishes existence and properties of stages

Aim
New method of studying *stages* in information processing, (a) without the limitations of Donders and (b) with the posssibility of *discovering* stages, (c) assess of these stages' properties, (d) testing of additivity and stochastic independence of their durations

        

        
DONDERS' METHOD
- strictly serial stages (i.e. additive) and stochastically independent
- elimination of stages: subtraction method
[Example?]

        

        
PROBLEMS WITH DONDERS' METHOD
- Deletion of stages may not (always) be possible. Substitution is more like it.
- We don't know whether they are:
* additive
* stochastically independent

        

        
Assumptions of Sternberg's method
PROPERTIES OF DONDERS' METHOD
- does not measure stage durations
- establishes existence and properties of stages

abstract = {An analysis of suicide by cop (SBC) among female subjects in a large sample (n = 707) of officer-involved shootings (OIS) is reported. Women represented 3\% of the total sample (n = 21) and 5\% (n = 12) of the 256 SBC cases. Therefore, 57\% of the women (n = 12) were classified as SBC, and 81\% of the women (n = 17) behaviorally evidenced some suicidal motivation. The results underscore that when a female subject becomes involved in a situation leading to an OIS, there is a very high likelihood that she is motivated to be intentionally killed. She is almost guaranteed to have a diagnosed mental disorder, has been prescribed psychiatric medications, and is abusing a substance at the time, most likely alcohol. Nevertheless, she also poses a serious risk of injury to both police officers and civilians during the encounter and will possess a firearm half the time. The wish for suicide is often precipitated by serious relationship issues. Comparisons are made to the male subjects in our previous study.},

abstract = {Participants' eye movements were recorded as they inspected a semi-realistic visual scene showing a boy, a cake, and various distractor objects. Whilst viewing this scene, they heard sentences such as 'the boy will move the cake' or 'the boy will eat the cake'. The cake was the only edible object portrayed in the scene. In each of two experiments, the onset of saccadic eye movements to the target object (the cake) was significantly later in the move condition than in the eat condition; saccades to the target were launched after the onset of the spoken word cake in the move condition, but before its onset in the eat condition. The results suggest that information at the verb can be used to restrict the domain within the context to which subsequent reference will be made by the (as yet unencountered) post-verbal grammatical object. The data support a hypothesis in which sentence processing is driven by the predictive relationships between verbs, their syntactic arguments, and the real-world contexts in which they occur.},

Forgetting occurs when people fail to recover information that has been experienced previously. Most view forgetting as a nuisance, but the process is quite adaptive. This chapter provides a general tutorial on the psychology of forgetting. We focus on its empirical characteristics and proposed theoretical underpinnings, as revealed through studies with healthy human participants. We begin with a discussion of forgetting's adaptive value, followed by an examination of its functional and mathematical characteristics. Next, we discuss possible causal mechanisms in some detail: Why do we forget? Finally, we reconsider the meaning of forgetting and its proper role in memory theory.},

perspective on combining experimental and individual-differences
research. Here we illustrate this approach with two-rectangle cueing
in visual attention (Egly, Driver, \&amp; Rafal, 1994). We replicated
previous experimental cue-validity effects relating to a spatial
shift of attention within an object (spatial effect), to attention
switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of
attention towards the display centroid (attraction effect), taking
also into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other
trials. We simultaneously estimated variance/covariance components
of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and
attraction effects in addition to their mean RTs. The spatial effect
showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative
correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual
differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly
at the cued location than fast subjects. We compare this joint LMM
analysis of experimental effects and associated subject-related variances
and correlations with two alternative, frequently used, statistical
procedures.},

The new sociology of science has examined many features of scientific knowledge and practice, but has made only preliminary efforts to study data access. Building on ethnographic studies of scientific laboratories (and other constructivist work), this article suggests how the new sociology of science can study data access empirically. The article develops a perspective based on an analysis of the process of scientific production and the creation, packaging, and exchange of data streams. It also provides an example of how constructivist studies can contribute to policy analysis. 10.1177/107554709401500401},

We consider the case where the selection Markov kernel is absolutely continuous and has a density which is uniformly bounded away from 0. This class includes certain simulated annealing algorithms recently introduced by various authors. We show that, under mild conditions, the sequence of states generated by these algorithms converges in probability to the global minimum of the function. Unlike most previous studies where the cooling schedule is deterministic, our cooling schedule is allowed to be adaptive. We also address the issue of almost sure convergence versus convergence in probability.},

This effect was exhibited by first-pass reading times that are usually assumed to reflect initial syntactic commitments. These results are discussed in relation to Frazier and Clifton's recent proposals concerning attachment mechanisms in the case of “non-primary” relationships such as relative clauses, and more precisely the notion that early-closure attachments observed in cross-linguistic studies are determined by relatively late processes.

@article{HupeEtAl2001,
abstract = {We analyzed the extracellular responses of 70 V1 neurons (recorded
in 3 anesthetized macaque monkeys) to a single oriented line segment
(or bar) placed within the cell classical receptive field (RF), or
center of the RF. These responses could be modulated when rings of
bars were placed entirely outside, but around the RF (the "near"
surround region), as described in previous studies. Suppression was
the main effect. The response was enhanced for 12 neurons when orthogonal
bars in the surround were presented instead of bars having the same
orientation as the center bar. This orientation contrast property
is possibly involved in the mediation of perceptual pop-out. The
enhancement was delayed compared with the onset of the response by
about 40 ms. We also observed a suppression originating specifically
from the flanks of the surround. This "side-inhibition," significant
for nine neurons, was delayed by about 20 ms. We tested whether these
center/surround interactions in V1 depend on feedback connections
from area V2. V2 was inactivated by GABA injections. We used devices
made of six micropipettes to inactivate the convergent zone from
V2 to V1. We could reliably inactivate a 2- to 4-mm-wide region of
V2. Inactivation of V2 had no effect on the center/surround interactions
of V1 neurons, even those that were delayed. Therefore the center/surround
interactions of V1 neurons that might be involved in pop-out do not
appear to depend on feedback connections from V2, at least in the
anesthetized monkey. We conclude that these properties are probably
shaped by long-range connections within V1 or depend on other feedback
connections. The main effect of V2 inactivation was a decrease of
the response to the single bar for about 10\% of V1 neurons. The decrease
was delayed by <20 ms after the response onset. Even the earliest
neurons to respond could be affected by the feedback from V2. Together
with the results on feedback connections from MT (previous paper),
these findings show that feedback connections potentiate the responses
to stimulation of the RF center and are recruited very early for
the treatment of visual information.},

The noun phrase arguments of the verbs in the sentences were such that when thematic assignment occurred at the critical target word, the sentence was plausible (likely theme), implausible (unlikely theme), or anomalous (an inappropriate theme). Whereas the target word in the anomalous condition provided evidence of immediate disruption, the effect of the target word in the implausible condition was considerably delayed. The results thus indicate that when a word is anomalous, it has an immediate effect on eye movements, but that the effect of implausibility is not as immediate.},

abstract = {A difficulty in the development and testing of psychological models is that they are typically evaluated solely on their ability to fit experimental data, with little consideration given to their ability to fit other possible data patterns. By examining how well model A fits data generated by model B, and vice versa (a technique that we call landscaping), much safer inferences can be made about the meaning of a model's fit to data. We demonstrate the landscaping technique using four models of retention and 77 historical data sets, and show how the method can be used to: (1) evaluate the distinguishability of models, (2) evaluate the informativeness of data in distinguishing between models, and (3) suggest new ways to distinguish between models. The generality of the method is demonstrated in two other research areas (information integration and categorization), and its relationship to the important notion of model complexity is discussed.},

Although this kind of model can be applied to many experimental paradigms and provides much more insight than the analysis of mean response times can, it is still rarely used in cognitive psychology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that both semantic and syntactic information play a role in pronoun resolution in sentences. However, it is unclear what the relative contribution of these sources of information is for the establishment of a coreferential relationship between the pronoun and the antecedent in combination with a local structural case constraint on the pronoun (i.e. case assignment of a pronoun under preposition governing). In a prepositional phrase in German and Dutch, it is the preposition that assigns case to the pronoun. Furthermore, in these languages different overtly case-marked pronouns are used to refer to male and female persons. Thus, one can manipulate biological/syntactic gender features separately from case marking features. The major aim of this study was to determine what the influence of gender information in combination with a local structural case constraint is on the processing of a personal pronoun in a sentence. Event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments were performed in German and in Dutch. In a word by word sentence reading study in German and Dutch, gender congruency between the antecedent and the pronoun was manipulated and/or case assignment by the preposition was violated while ERPs of young native speakers were recorded. RESULTS: The German and the Dutch ERP data showed an enlarged negativity broadly distributed starting approximately 350 ms after onset of the pronoun followed by a late positivity for gender violations. For syntactic incongruencies without gender violations only a positivity was present. The Dutch data showed an earlier onset of the positivity in comparison to German. CONCLUSION: Finding negativities and positivities for conditions with a gender violation indicates that pronoun resolution with gender incongruency between the pronoun and the antecedent suffers from semantic as well as syntactic integration problems. The presence of a positivity for the syntactically incongruent conditions without gender violations suggests that the processing of incorrect case marking without a gender violation gives rise to syntactic but not semantic integration problems. We suggest that the more prominent case violation in Dutch caused the earlier onset of the positivity in the Dutch study. In addition, the pattern of ERP effects shows that both case and gender information are used almost immediately implying that the local structural constraint affects the resolution process with more processing activity than for a pronoun of which only one source of information is violated or incongruent.},

abstract = {An eye-tracking experiment examined whether prosodic cues can affect the interpretation of grammatical functions in the absence of clear morphological information. German listeners were presented with scenes depicting three potential referents while hearing temporarily ambiguous SVO and OVS sentences. While case marking on the first noun phrase (NP) was ambiguous, clear case marking on the second NP disambiguated sentences towards SVO or OVS. Listeners interpreted case-ambiguous NP1s more often as Subject, and thus expected an Object as upcoming argument, only when sentence beginnings carried an SVO-type intonation. This was revealed by more anticipatory eye movements to suitable Patients (Objects) than Agents (Subjects) in the visual scenes. No such preference was found when sentence beginnings had an OVS-type intonation. Prosodic cues were integrated rapidly enough to affect listeners' interpretation of grammatical function before disambiguating case information was available. We conclude that in addition to manipulating attachment ambiguities, prosody can influence the interpretation of constituent order ambiguities.},

In thisarticle, the authors present an alternative account motivated by a connectionist approach to languagecomprehension. In their view, processing capacity emerges from network architecture and experienceand is not a primitive that can vary independently. Individual differences in comprehension do not stemfrom variations in a separate working memory capacity; instead they emerge from an interaction ofbiological factors and language experience. This alternative is argued to provide a superior account ofcomprehension results previously attributed to a separate working memory capacity.},

The regression-contingent analysis that they used involves an implicit assumption that regressive eye movements are a necessary consequence of subjects' being garden pathed.

abstract = {On-line comprehension studies of flexible word-order languages find that noncanonical ('scrambled') structures induce more difficulty than canonical structures e.g., Hyona \& Hujanen, Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 50A (1997) 841-858, with this difference being attributed to the structural complexity/infrequency of these forms. However, by presenting sentences in isolation, most existing studies have not examined the extent to which processing patterns can be explained by discourse factors. In Finnish, an articleless flexible word-order language with canonical SVO order, word order can be used to encode the given/new distinctions: OVS marks the object as given and the subject as new; SVO is more flexible, being used in multiple contexts. Thus, the observed dispreference for noncanonical orders in previous work may arise from additional presuppositions needed to understand them out of context cf. Crain \& Steedman, Natural Language Parsing, (1985), 320-358. Two experiments were conducted to examine these issues in Finnish. Experiment 1 used a self-paced reading task to show that the usual difficulty associated with noncanonical constructions is partially alleviated in the presence of appropriate discourse contexts. In Experiment 2, the eye gaze of listeners was tracked as they heard spoken descriptions of scenes, so as to test whether specific on-line referential processes are involved in SVO/OVS comprehension: Upon hearing an OV... sequence, Finnish listeners should expect the upcoming noun to be discourse-new, whereas an SV... sequence makes no such prediction. The results confirmed these predictions. As compared to SVO, OVS sentences showed anticipatory eye movements to a discourse-new referent at the second noun onset, even before participants had enough acoustic information to recognize this word. Our findings illustrate that in a flexible word-order language, a noncanonical order can result in anticipatory processes regarding the discourse status of a yet-to-be-heard constituent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on how to share patient records privately. Data privacy concepts are surveyed and a framework is presented for the safe sharing of sensitive data. It is argued that tailoring the data sharing to the privacy breach risks of each project holds out the best compromise for keeping the trust of the public and providing for the best quality data where detailed patient consent is not possible. OBJECTIVE: To improve the protection of data by reducing privacy breaches and thus enable appropriate patient data sharing without consent. FRAMEWORK: Any harm arising from data sharing must come from the data being identified, either fully or partially. The first step is an agreement on an acceptable privacy breach risk. Next, proceed to measure that risk for the proposed data when held by a given recipient. Finally, select from a menu of mitigation strategies (people, process and technical) to achieve acceptable risk. The framework is tested against the current UK approach administered by the Patient Information Advisory Group. DISCUSSION: The hard problem of non-consented data sharing should be divided into the easier (though non-trivial) ones of data and recipient breach risk measurement. Directed research in these two areas will help move the data sharing problem into the 'solved' pile.},

Recent developments in sampling-based search methods in statistics make it possible to determine these values and thereby identify an optimal experimental design. After describing the method, it is demonstrated in 2 content areas in cognitive psychology in which models are highly competitive: retention (i.e., forgetting) and categorization. The optimal design is compared with the quality of designs used in the literature. The findings demonstrate that design optimization has the potential to increase the informativeness of the experimental method.},

abstract = {
The deluge of research data has excited researchers, policy makers, and the general public. Not only might research be reproducible, but new questions can be asked, with great benefit to research, innovation, education, and the citizenry. However, very little data is being shared, despite the best efforts of funding agencies and journals. This article explores the complexities of data, research practices, innovation, incentives, economics, intellectual property, and public policy associated with the data sharing conundrum – “an intricate and difficult problem.” Research data take many forms, are collected for many purposes, via many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Rationales for sharing data vary along two dimensions: whether motivated by research concerns or by leveraging public investments, and whether intended to serve the interests of researchers who produce data or the interests of potential re-users of data. Four rationales for sharing research data are identified and positioned on these dimensions. Researchers’ incentives to share their data depend not only on these rationales, but on characteristics of their data and research practices, funding agency policies, and resources for data management. Much more is understood about why researchers do not share data than about when, why, and how researchers do share data, or about when, how, and why researchers or the public reuse data. The model and research agenda are illustrated with examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities.Requested citation to this version: Borgman, Christine L. (2011, submitted).

abstract = {Behavioral studies investigating the influence of the relative word frequency of antecedent nouns on the processing of anaphoric pronouns have yielded contradictory results. While some researchers found no effect of an antecedent's frequency of occurrence on coreference resolution [J. Simner, R. Smyth, Phonological activation in anaphoric lexical access (ALA), Brain Lang. 68 (1999) 40-45], others report shorter reading times for pronouns referring to low compared to high frequency nouns [R.G.P. van Gompel, A. Majid, Antecedent frequency effects during the processing of pronouns, Cognition 90 (2004) 255-264]. Using event-related potentials, our study aimed to further investigate the issue. Participants were presented with sentence pairs, of which the first contained either a high frequency, a middle frequency or a low frequency noun. The second sentence contained a pronoun which referred back to the noun in the first sentence. ERP waves were determined, time-locked to both the nouns and the anaphoric pronouns. We observed a graded N400 effect for antecedents of the three frequency classes with amplitudes reversely related to the word's lexical frequency. Coreferential pronouns elicited a P300, with amplitudes dependent on the noun's relative frequency of occurrence, i.e. the lower the antecedent's word frequency, the higher was the amplitude of the P300. This amplitude effect at the pronoun is interpreted in terms of the allocation of attentional resources to salient discourse entities.},

abstract = {Processing information in working memory requires selective access to a subset of working-memory contents by a focus of attention. Complex cognition often requires joint access to 2 items in working memory. How does the focus select 2 items? Two experiments with an arithmetic task and 1 with a spatial task investigate time demands for successive operations that involve 2 digits or 2 spatial positions, respectively. When both items used in an operation have been used in the preceding operation, latencies are shortened. No such repetition benefit (arithmetic) or a much smaller benefit (spatial) was found when only 1 item was repeated. The results rule out serial access to the 2 items, parallel access by expanding the focus, and parallel access by splitting the focus. They support the notion that 2 items are accessed by chunking them, so that they fit a focus limited to 1 chunk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).},

Completionproportions up to and including the were influenced by thematic fit. The results were simulatedusing a competition model in which independently quantified syntactic and semantic constraintssimultaneously influenced interpretation. Predictions were then generated for a self-paced readingtask using model parameter values established by the off-line simulations. The pattern of readingtimes matched the predictions of the constraint-based version of the model but differed substan-tially from a one-region delay garden-path version. In addition, a garden-path model with a veryshort delay simulated the data better than the one-region delay model, but not as closely as theconstraint-based version. The experiment and modeling illustrate that thematic fit is computedand used immediately in on-line sentence comprehension. Furthermore, the modeling highlightedthe difficulty of interpreting sentence comprehension experiments without both quantifying therelevant constraints and implementing the mechanisms involved.},

This sampling procedure, called the parametric bootstrap cross-fitting method (PBCM; cf. Williams (J. R. Statist. Soc. B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-fit expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have specific parameter values obtained by fitting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-fit to allow a quantification of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

abstract = {Two experiments are described in which participants read sentences of the form ``He drank some . . .'' in contexts which either did or did not introduce something drinkable. Participants were more likely to report that the sentence stopped making sense at the verb ``drank'' if nothing drinkable had been introduced. When participants responded, in this case, that the verb did make sense, their reaction times tended to be elevated relative to when the context did introduce a suitable antecedent. The experiments were modeled on a series of studies reported by Boland, Tanenhaus, Garnsey, and Carlson (1995), who used the same stop-making-sense judgment task to investigate the processing of filler-gap dependencies of the form ``I wondered which food the man drank . . . .'' They observed increased ``no'' responses on the verb when the prior filler was an implausible recipient of the patient role associated with the verb and concluded that the wh-phrase is assigned a thematic role as soon as the verb ``drank'' is encountered. In the studies reported here, with materials which did not contain obligatory syntactic (filler-gap) dependencies, the equivalent phenomenon was observed---thematic information conveyed by a verb's lexical entry was apparently evaluated, at the verb, with respect to its fit with whatever contextually introduced entities were available to receive the associated role. The data suggest that thematic roles may be assigned at a verb on the basis of thematic fit with context.},

Selection methods are introduced that factor in these properties when measuring fit.

heuristic but intuitively reasonable procedures, and most clustering
methods available in commercial software are also of this type. 
However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these
methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster
analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method
should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general
methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled
statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can
be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant
analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from
medical diagnosis, mine eld detection, cluster recovery from noisy
data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations
of the methodology and discuss recent developments in model-based
clustering for non-Gaussian data, high-dimensional datasets, large

while subjects discriminated patterned targets within distractor

map the boundaries of retinotopic visual areas and to localize attention-related
changes in neural activity within several of those areas, including
primary visual (striate) cortex. Event-related potentials (ERPs)
and modeling of their neural sources, however, indicated that the
initial sensory input to striate cortex at 50-55 milliseconds after
the stimulus was not modulated by attention. The earliest facilitation
of attended signals was observed in extrastriate visual areas, at
70-75 milliseconds. We hypothesize that the striate cortex modulation
found with fMRI may represent a delayed, re-entrant feedback from
higher visual areas or a sustained biasing of striate cortical neurons
during attention. ERP recordings provide critical temporal information
for analyzing the functional neuroanatomy of visual attention.},

It is shown that this approach generalizes the approach of mean imputation in the linear case and the resulting kernel machine reduces to the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) when no input values are missing. Furthermore, the method is extended to the multivariate case of fitting additive models using componentwise kernel machines, and an efficient implementation is based on the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier formulation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To better understand the variety and prevalence of data withholding in genetics and the other life sciences and to explore factors associated with these behaviors. METHOD: In 2000, a sample of 2,893 geneticists and other life scientists (OLS) at the 100 most research-intensive universities in the United States were surveyed concerning data withholding and sharing. The instrument was developed and pretested in 1999. The two primary outcome measures were withholding in verbal exchanges with colleagues about unpublished research (verbal withholding) and withholding as part of the publishing process (publishing withholding). The independent variables related to the personal characteristics, research characteristics of faculty, and previous experience with data withholding. RESULTS: A total of 1,849 faculty responded (64\%): 1,240 geneticists and 600 OLS. Forty-four percent of geneticists and 32\% of OLS reported participating in any one of 13 forms of data withholding in the three previous years. Publishing withholding (geneticists 35\%, OLS 25\%) was more frequent than verbal withholding (geneticists 23\%, OLS 12\%). In multivariate analyses, male gender, participation in relationships with industry, mentors' discouraging data sharing, receipt of formal instruction in data sharing, and negative past experience with sharing were significantly associated with either verbal or publishing withholding among either geneticists or OLS. CONCLUSIONS: Data withholding is common in biomedical science, takes multiple forms, is influenced by a variety of characteristics of investigators and their training, and varies by field of science. Encouraging openness during the formative experiences of young investigators may be critical to increased data sharing, but the effects of formal training do not appear straightforward.},

abstract = {Two questionnaire studies and three on-line experiments were carried
out in an attempt to determine whether a parsing strategy which is
widely used in English (the Late Closure strategy) simply represents
an arbitrarily chosen procedure or whether it is likely to have become
a relatively stable feature of the parsing routine because it confers
real information processing advantages on the reader or listener.
Experiment 1A showed that Spanish readers apparently do not use the
Late Closure strategy to interpret a particular type of sentence.
With comparable materials, however, English readers do use this strategy
(Experiment 1B). Experiments 2, 3 and 4 showed that the structural
choices were made while the subjects were actually reading the sentence.
The results throw doubt on the suggestion that the Late Closure strategy
is favoured (in English) mainly because it is efficient in information
processing terms. It may be that different languages make use of
parsing strategies in an essentially arbitrary way. Implications
for general theories of human parsing are discussed.},

abstract = {Skilled readers read passages that were displayed on a Cathode Ray Tube controlled by a computer. The readers' eye movements were monitored and certain critical words were changed by the computer as the eye was in motion. The experimental technique utilized in the study provided data on how wide the area is from which a reader acquires information during a fixation in silent reading. The results also delineate different types of visual information that are acquired from various areas within the perceptual span. It was found that a reader was able to make a semantic interpretation of a word that began 1–6 character spaces from his fixation point. When he fixated 7–12 character spaces prior to a word, he was able to pick up such gross visual characteristics as word shape and initial and final letters. It was concluded that the skilled reader is able to take advantage of information in the periphery. However, the size of the area from which he does is rather small.},

processes is used to studyminimal models of the control of eye movements

a rather complicated trajectory ± almostlike a random walk. Mathematical
models of eyemovement control can account for this behavior usingstochastic
transition rules between few discrete internalstates, which represent
combinations of certain stages oflexical access and saccade programs.
We show thatexperimentally observed ®xation durations can beexplained
by residence-time-dependent transition prob-abilities. Stochastic
processes with this property areknown as semi-Markov processes. For
our numericalsimulations we use the minimal process method (Gilles-pie
algorithm), which is an exact and ecient simulationalgorithm for
this class of stochastic processes. Withinthis mathematical framework,
we study dierent formsof coupling between eye movements and shifts
of covertattention in reading. Our model lends support to theexistence
of autonomous saccades, i.e., the hypothesisthat initiations of saccades
are not completely determined by lexical access processes.},

Here we exploited a phonological regularity of English indefinite articles ('an' precedes nouns beginning with vowel sounds, whereas 'a' precedes nouns beginning with consonant sounds) in combination with event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp to show that readers' brains can pre-activate individual words in a graded fashion to a degree that can be estimated from the probability that each word is given as a continuation for a sentence fragment offline. These findings are evidence that readers use the words in a sentence (as cues to their world knowledge) to estimate relative likelihoods for upcoming words.},

In Experiment 1 we show that sentences containing ambiguous pronouns are processed at the same speed as those containing unambiguous pronouns under shallow processing, but more slowly under deep processing. We outline three possible models to account for the shallow processing of ambiguous pronouns. Two involve an initial commitment followed by possible revision, and the other involves a delay in interpretation. In Experiment 2 we provide evidence that supports the delayed model of ambiguous pronoun resolution under shallow processing. We found no evidence to support a processing system that makes an initial commitment to an interpretation of the pronoun when it is encountered. We extend the account of pronoun resolution proposed by Rigalleau, Caplan, and Baudiffier (2004) to include the treatment of ambiguous pronouns under shallow processing.},

After determining the psychological mean of two sizes, we measured thresholds for judging the mean with arrays of 12 circles of heterogeneous sizes. They were close to those for the size of elements in homogeneous arrays and single elements, and were little affected by either exposure duration (50-1000 ms) or memory delays (up to 2s). They were only slightly more accurate within the same distribution than across different distributions (normal, uniform, two-peaks, and homogeneous), confirming that subjects were indeed averaging sizes.},

abstract = {To model behavior, scientists need to know how models behave. This means learning what other behaviors a model can produce besides the one generated by participants in an experiment. This is a difficult problem because of the complexity of psychological models (e.g., their many parameters) and because the behavioral precision of models (e.g., interval-scale performance) often mismatches their testable precision in experiments, where qualitative, ordinal predictions are the norm. Parameter space partitioning is a solution that evaluates model performance at a qualitative level. There exists a partition on the model's parameter space that divides it into regions that correspond to each data pattern. Three application examples demonstrate its potential and versatility for studying the global behavior of psychological models.},

abstract = {Structural reanalysis is generally assumed to be representation-preserving, whereby the initial analysis is manipulated or repaired to arrive at a new structure. This paper contends that the theoretical and empirical basis for such approaches is weak. A conceptually simpler alternative is that the processor reprocesses (some portion of) the input using just those structure-building operations available in first-pass parsing. This reprocessing is a necessary component of any realistic processing model. By contrast, the structural revisions required for second-pass repair are more powerful than warranted by the abilities of the first-pass parser. This paper also reviews experimental evidence for repair presented by Sturt, Pickering, and Crocker (1999). We demonstrate that the Sturt et. al. findings are consistent with a reprocessing account and present a self-paced reading experiment intended to tease apart the repair and reprocessing accounts. The results support a reprocessing interpretation of Sturt et. al.'s data, rendering a repair-based explanation superfluous.},

abstract = {Background: Dataset submissions are growingexponentially. Links between datasetsubmissions and primary literature that describethe data collection are useful for many reasons:rich documentation, proper attribution, improvedinformation retrieval, and enhanced text/dataintegration for analysis. Unfortunately, manydatabase submissions do not include primarycitation links, as database submissions are oftenmade prior to publication. We suggest thatautomated tools can be developed to helpidentify links between dataset submissions andthe primary literature. These tools require fulltext to differentiate cases of data sharing fromdata reuse and other contexts. In this study, weexplore the possibility that deep analysis of fulltext may not be necessary, thereby enabling thequerying of all reports in PubMed Central.Methods: We trained machine learning treeand rule-based classifiers on full-text openaccessarticle unigram vectors, with theexistence of a primary citation link from NCBI'sGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databasesubmission records as the binary output class.We manually combined and simplified theclassifier trees and rules to create a querycompatible with the interface for PubMedCentral.Results: The query identified 40\% of non-OAarticles with dataset submission links from GEO(recall), and 65\% of the returned articles withoutdataset submission links were manually judgedto include statements of dataset deposit despitehaving no link from the database (applicableprecision).Conclusion: We hope this work inspires futureenhancements, and highlights the opportunitiesfor simple full-text queries in PubMed Centralgiven the mandated influx of NIH-fundedresearch reports.},

First, it provides a means of estimating the shape, scale, and location (shift) of RT distributions. Second, it is hierarchical and models between-subjects and within-subjects variability simultaneously. Third, inference with the model is Bayesian and provides a principled and efficient means of pooling information across disparate data from different individuals. Because the model efficiently pools information across individuals, it is particularly well suited for those common cases in which the researcher collects a limited number of observations from several participants. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the hierarchical Bayesian model provides more accurate estimates than several popular competitors do. We illustrate the model by providing an analysis of the symbolic distance effect in which participants can more quickly ascertain the relationship between nonadjacent digits than that between adjacent digits.},

@article{ShermanKoch1986,
abstract = {In the mammalian visual system, the lateral geniculate nucleus is
commonly thought to act merely as a relay for the transmission of
visual information from the retina to the visual cortex, a relay
without significant elaboration in receptive field properties or
signal strength. However, many morphological and electrophysiological
observations are at odds with this view. Only 10-20\% of the synapses
found on geniculate relay neurons are retinal in origin. Roughly
half of all synapses derive from cells in layer VI of visual cortex;
roughly one third are inhibitory and GABAergic, derived either from
interneurons or from cells of the nearby perigeniculate nucleus.
Most of the remaining synapses probably derive from cholinergic,
noradrenergic, and serotonergic sites within the brainstem reticular
formation. Moreover, recent biophysical studies have revealed several
ionic currents present in virtually all thalamic neurons. One is
a Ca2+-dependent K+ current underlying the afterhyperpolarization
(or the IAHP), which may last up to 100-200 ms following an action
potential. Activation of the IAHP leads to spike frequency adaptation
in response to a sustained, suprathreshold input. Intracellular recordings
from other neuronal preparations have shown that the IAHP can be
blocked by noradrenaline or acetylcholine, leading to an increased
cellular excitability. Another ionic current results from a voltage-
and time-dependent Ca2+ conductance that produces a low threshold
spike. Activation of this conductance transforms a geniculate neuron
from a state of faithful relay of information to one of bursting
behavior that bears little relationship to the activity of its retinal
afferents. We propose that state-dependent gating of geniculate relay
cells, which may represent part of the neuronal substrate involved
in certain forms of selective visual attention, can be effected through
at least three different mechanisms: conventional GABAergic inhibition,
which is largely controlled via brainstem and cortical afferents
through interneurons and perigeniculate cells; the IAHP, which is
controlled via noradrenergic and cholinergic afferents from the brainstem
reticular formation; and the low threshold spike, which may be controlled
by GABAergic inputs, cholinergic inputs, and/or the corticogeniculate
input, although other possibilities also exist. Furthermore, it seems
likely that gating functions involving the corticogeniculate pathway
are suited to attentional processes within the visual domain (e.g.,
saccadic suppression), whereas brainstem inputs seem more likely
to have more global effects that switch attention between sensory
systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite increasing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to biomedical text, whether this technology can facilitate tasks such as database curation remains unclear.RESULTS:PaperBrowser is the first NLP-powered interface that was developed under a user-centered approach to improve the way in which FlyBase curators navigate an article. In this paper, we first discuss how observing curators at work informed the design and evaluation of PaperBrowser. Then, we present how we appraise PaperBrowser's navigational functionalities in a user-based study using a text highlighting task and evaluation criteria of Human-Computer Interaction. Our results show that PaperBrowser reduces the amount of interactions between two highlighting events and therefore improves navigational efficiency by about 58\% compared to the navigational mechanism that was previously available to the curators. Moreover, PaperBrowser is shown to provide curators with enhanced navigational utility by over 74\% irrespective of the different ways in which they highlight text in the article.CONCLUSIONS:We show that state-of-the-art performance in certain NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition and Anaphora Resolution can be combined with the navigational functionalities of PaperBrowser to support curation quite successfully.},

The first section assesses the power of different methods of minimizing the effect of outliers on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and makes recommendations about the use of transformations and cutoffs. The second section examines the effect of outliers and cutoffs on different measures of location, spread, and shape and concludes using quantitative examples that robust measures are much less affected by outliers and cutoffs than measures based on moments. The third section examines fitting explicit distribution functions as a way of recovering means and standard deviations and concludes that unless fitting the distribution function is used as a model of distribution shape, the method is probably not worth routine use.},

The current paper reports two studies, in which speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-tracking methodologies were used with the same materials to provide converging evidence for the role of syntactic and semantic cues as mediators of both proactive (PI) and retroactive interference (RI) during comprehension. Consistent with previous work (e.g., Van Dyke \& Lewis, 2003), we found that syntactic constraints at the retrieval site are among the cues that drive retrieval in comprehension, and that these constraints effectively limit interference from potential distractors with semantic/pragmatic properties in common with the target constituent. The data are discussed in terms of a cue-overload account, in which interference both arises from and is mediated through a direct-access retrieval mechanism that utilizes a linear, weighted cue-combinatoric scheme.},

abstract = {Two eye-tracking experiments investigated processing of unbounded dependency constructions. Experiment 1 employed sentences like Thats the garage/pistol with which the heartless killer shot the man yesterday afternoon. Readers experienced greater processing difficulty in implausible sen- tences than in plausible sentences immediately after encountering the verb shot. This demonstrated that they did not wait until the purported gap location after man before forming the unbounded dependency. Experiment 2 considered sentences which locally appear to have an unbounded depen- dency that turns out to be incorrect. Data from this experiment demonstrated that readers formed the unbounded dependency immediately, even though they had to reanalyze later. However, there was no evidence that readers formed this unbounded dependency when it was rendered ungrammatical by island-constraint information. We argue that the processor constructs unbounded dependencies in a manner that is maximally efficient from the point of view of incremental processing.},

We apply a tailored process model of choice RT to a speeded semantic categorization task in order to deconfound different sources of variability in RT. Our model is based on a diffusion model of choice RT, extended to include crossed random effects (of items and participants). This model retains the interesting process interpretation of the diffusion model's parameters, but it can be applied to choice RTs even in the case where there are few or no repeated measurements of each participant-item combination. Different aspects of the response process are then linked to different types of item properties. A typicality measure turns out to predict the rate of information uptake, while a lexicographic measure predicts the stimulus encoding time. Accessibility measures cannot reliably predict any component of the decision process.},

Event-related brain potentials revealed that dative-marked objects in the initial position of an embedded sentence do not elicit a neurophysiologically distinct response from subjects, whereas accusative-marked objects do. These differences are predictable on the basis of grammatical distinctions (i.e. underlying linguistic properties), but not on the basis of frequency information (i.e. a superficial linguistic property).

@article{Manion:2009p9703,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data protection is important for all information systems that deal with human-subjects data. Grid-based systems--such as the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG)--seek to develop new mechanisms to facilitate real-time federation of cancer-relevant data sources, including sources protected under a variety of regulatory laws, such as HIPAA and 21CFR11. These systems embody new models for data sharing, and hence pose new challenges to the regulatory community, and to those who would develop or adopt them. These challenges must be understood by both systems developers and system adopters. In this paper, we describe our work collecting policy statements, expectations, and requirements from regulatory decision makers at academic cancer centers in the United States. We use these statements to examine fundamental assumptions regarding data sharing using data federations and grid computing. METHODS: An interview-based study of key stakeholders from a sample of US cancer centers. Interviews were structured, and used an instrument that was developed for the purpose of this study. The instrument included a set of problem scenarios--difficult policy situations that were derived during a full-day discussion of potentially problematic issues by a set of project participants with diverse expertise. Each problem scenario included a set of open-ended questions that were designed to elucidate stakeholder opinions and concerns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, data was aggregated at the individual or institutional unit of analysis, depending on the specific interview question. RESULTS: Thirty-one (31) individuals at six cancer centers were contacted to participate. Twenty-four out of thirty-one (24/31) individuals responded to our request- yielding a total response rate of 77\%. Respondents included IRB directors and policy-makers, privacy and security officers, directors of offices of research, information security officers and university legal counsel. Nineteen total interviews were conducted over a period of 16 weeks. Respondents provided answers for all four scenarios (a total of 87 questions). Results were grouped by broad themes, including among others: governance, legal and financial issues, partnership agreements, de-identification, institutional technical infrastructure for security and privacy protection, training, risk management, auditing, IRB issues, and patient/subject consent. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that with additional work, large scale federated sharing of data within a regulated environment is possible. A key challenge is developing suitable models for authentication and authorization practices within a federated environment. Authentication--the recognition and validation of a person's identity--is in fact a global property of such systems, while authorization - the permission to access data or resources--mimics data sharing agreements in being best served at a local level. Nine specific recommendations result from the work and are discussed in detail.

abstract = {The availability of well-characterized neuroimaging data with large numbers of subjects, especially for clinical populations, is critical to advancing our understanding of the healthy and diseased brain. Such data enables questions to be answered in a much more generalizable manner and also has the potential to yield solutions derived from novel methods that were conceived after the original studies' implementation. Though there is currently growing interest in data sharing, the neuroimaging community has been struggling for years with how to best encourage sharing data across brain imaging studies. With the advent of studies that are much more consistent across sites (e.g., resting functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural imaging) the potential of pooling data across studies continues to gain momentum. At the mind research network, we have developed the collaborative informatics and neuroimaging suite (COINS; http://coins.mrn.org) to provide researchers with an information system based on an open-source model that includes web-based tools to manage studies, subjects, imaging, clinical data, and other assessments. The system currently hosts data from nine institutions, over 300 studies, over 14,000 subjects, and over 19,000 MRI, MEG, and EEG scan sessions in addition to more than 180,000 clinical assessments. In this paper we provide a description of COINS with comparison to a valuable and popular system known as XNAT. Although there are many similarities between COINS and other electronic data management systems, the differences that may concern researchers in the context of multi-site, multi-organizational data sharing environments with intuitive ease of use and PHI security are emphasized as important attributes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper presents three experiments that investigate the relationship between gradient and binary judgments of grammaticality. In the first two experiments, two different groups of participants judged sentences by the method of magnitude estimation and by the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in a single session. The two experiments involved identical sentence materials but they differed in the order in which the two procedures were applied. The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either grammatical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judgments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments. Finally, we compare our experimental results to existing corpus data in order to inquire into the relationship between grammaticality and frequency of usage.},

We argue and illustrate that using dissociation logic to draw conclusions about the dimensionality of data is flawed.

We formally describe the cognitive structure and parametric properties of the class of MPT models and provide an inferential statistical analysis for the entire class. Following this, we provide a comprehensive review of over 80 applications of MPT models to a variety of substantive areas in cognitive psychology, including various types of human memory, visual and auditory perception, and logical reasoning. We then address a number of theoretical issues relevant to the creation and evaluation of MPT models, including model development, model validity, discrete-state assumptions, statistical issues, and the relation between MPT models and other mathematical models. In the conclusion, we consider the current role of MPT models in psychological research and possible future directions.},

abstract = {In this review, the origins and history of a test of rapid automatized
naming (RAN) are traced from nineteenth-century classical brain-behavior
analyses of cases of acquired “alexia without agraphia” through adaptations
to studies of normal and reading disabled children. The element of
speed (of responding verbally to a visual stimulus) was derived from
a test of color naming developed over 50 years ago as a bedside measure
of recovery from brain injuries. Merging the “visual-verbal” connection
essential to reading (specific) with the response time element (general),
RAN turned out to be a useful correlate and predictor of reading
competence, accounting even for variance beyond that accounted for
by timed tests of discrete naming. As one of the two deficits highlighted
in the Double Deficit hypothesis with phonological awareness, RAN
has emerged as something more than a particularly difficult challenge
to a unitary phonological retrieval deficit, and has itself been
subjected to further dissection. Coming full circle to its origins,
recent research suggests that RAN taps both visual-verbal (language
domain) and processing speed (executive domain) contributions to
reading.},

abstract = {In the literature dealing with the reanalysis of garden path sentences such as While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods, it is generally assumed either that people completely repair their initial incorrect syntactic representations to yield a final interpretation whose syntactic structure is fully consistent with the input string or that the parse fails. In a series of five experiments, we explored the possibility that partial reanalyses take place. Specifically, we examined the conditions under which part of the initial incorrect analysis persists at the same time that part of the correct final analysis is constructed. In Experiments 1a and 1b, we found that both the length of the ambiguous region and the plausibility of the ultimate interpretation affected the likelihood that such sentences would be fully reanalyzed. In Experiment 2, we compared garden path sentences with non-garden path sentences and compared performance on two different types of comprehension questions. In Experiments 3a and 3b, we constructed garden path sentences using a small class of syntactically unique verbs to provide converging evidence against the position that people employ some sort of “general reasoning” or pragmatic inference when faced with syntactically difficult garden paths. The results from these experiments indicate that reanalysis of such sentences is not always complete, so that comprehenders often derive an interpretation for the full sentence in which part of the initial misanalysis persists. We conclude that the goal of language processing is not always to create an idealized structure, but rather to create a representation that is “good enough” to satisfy the comprehender that an appropriate interpretation has been obtained.},

abstract = {The authors examined whether people can use their knowledge of the wider discourse rapidly enough to anticipate specific upcoming words as a sentence is unfolding. In an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, subjects heard Dutch stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun. To probe whether this noun was anticipated at a preceding indefinite article, stories were continued with a gender-marked adjective whose suffix mismatched the upcoming noun's syntactic gender. Prediction-inconsistent adjectives elicited a differential ERP effect, which disappeared in a no-discourse control experiment. Furthermore, in self-paced reading, prediction-inconsistent adjectives slowed readers down before the noun. These findings suggest that people can indeed predict upcoming words in fluent discourse and, moreover, that these predicted words can immediately begin to participate in incremental parsing operations.},

Despite how commonly it occurs, very little is known about mindless reading. The present experiment examined eye movements during mindless reading. Comparisons of fixation-duration measures collected during intervals of normal reading and intervals of mindless reading indicate that fixations during the latter were longer and less affected by lexical and linguistic variables than fixations during the former. Also, eye movements immediately preceding self-caught mind wandering were especially erratic. These results suggest that the cognitive processes that guide eye movements during normal reading are not engaged during mindless reading. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of eye movement control in reading, for the distinction between experiential awareness and meta-awareness, and for reading comprehension.},

For a welcoming environment, the BDR provides simple, straightforward policies and procedures for contributing data and for using available data. Contributing investigators provide information through the BDR Gridsphere-based Portal environment to allow meaningful sharing of their data, and, when relevant, supply documentation for human subjects' protection.

Eye movements in the disambiguating region (by the director) revealed that, in the relative clause biasing contexts, ambiguous reduced relatives were no more difficult to process than unambiguous reduced relatives or full (unreduced) relatives. Regression analyses demonstrated that the effects of discourse context at the point of ambiguity (e.g., selected) interacted with the past participle frequency of the ambiguous verb. Reading times were modeled using a constraint-based competition framework in which multiple constraints are immediately integrated during parsing and interpretation. Simulations suggested that this framework reconciles the superficially conflicting results in the literature on referential context effects on syntactic ambiguity resolution.},

Three experiments are summarized that were designed to investigate the reanalysis and interpretation of relatively difficult garden-path sentences (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed). After reading such sentences, participants correctly believed that the baby spit up on the bed; however, they often confidently, yet incorrectly, believed that Anna dressed the baby. These results demonstrate that garden-path reanalysis is not an all-or-nothing process and that thematic roles initially assigned for the subordinate clause verb are not consistently revised. The implications of the partial reanalysis phenomenon for Fodor and Inoue's (1998) model of reanalysis and sentence processing are discussed. In addition, we discuss the possibility that language processing often creates "good enough" structures rather than ideal structures.},

abstract = {Meng and Bader(2000b)have shown that for garden-path repair in German,
case is a more effective cue than number. They argue that sensitivity
to the nature of the cue supports a diagnosis model of garden path
repair such as we have proposed. However, in making this argument
Meng and Bader introduced a new notion of diagnosis. Retaining the
original "basic" diagnosis system,they added a new function that
we call triage. Triage determines the probable revisability of a
structure, in order to decide whether to make the effort of trying
to reanalyze it. To determine whether triage is a feature of human
parsing, its scope must be established. We compare four hypotheses
about how much work triage could do. A powerful triage component
would succeed where the human parser fails. Limited F\_local triage
does no work if symptom effectiveness varies within a F\_language.
An intermediate hypothesis discriminates better between easy and
difficult revisions. However, this variant of triage with the strongest
claim to psychological reality is the most difficult to distinguish
from no triage at all, since it shares important properties with
basic diagnosis. We identify some empirical predictions that differentiate
diagnosis with triage from simple basic diagnosis. What F\_little
evidence there is at present suggests that the human sentence parser
has no triage capability.},

abstract = {This paper reports two experiments using sentences with a temporary ambiguity between a direct object and a sentence complement analysis that is resolved toward the normally preferred direct object analysis. Postverbal noun phrases in these sentences could be ambiguously attached as either a direct object or the subject of a sentence complement, whereas in unambiguous versions of the sentences the subcategorization of the verb forced the direct object interpretation. Participants read these sentences in relatively long paragraph contexts, where the context supported the direct object analysis ("preferred"), supported the sentence complement analysis ("unpreferred"), or provided conflicting evidence about both analyses ("conflicting"). Self-paced reading times for ambiguous postverbal noun phrases were almost equivalent to the reading times of their unambiguous counterparts, even in unpreferred and conflicted context conditions. However, time to read a following region, which forced the direct object interpretation, was affected by the interaction of verb subcategorization ambiguity and contextual support. The full pattern of results do not fit well with either an unelaborated single-analysis ("garden path") model or a competitive constraint-satisfaction model, but are consistent with a race model in which multiple factors affect the speed of constructing a single initial analysis.},

Alternative autonomous theories posit feed-forward processing with lexical influence restricted to post-perceptual decision processes. We review evidence supporting the prediction of interactive models that lexical influences can affect pre-lexical mechanisms, triggering compensation, adaptation and retuning of phonological processes generally taken to be pre-lexical.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Environmental sequence datasets are increasing at an exponential rate; however, the vast majority of them lack appropriate descriptors like sampling location, time and depth/altitude: generally referred to as metadata or contextual data. The consistent capture and structured submission of these data is crucial for integrated data analysis and ecosystems modeling. The application MetaBar has been developed, to support consistent contextual data acquisition. RESULTS: MetaBar is a spreadsheet and web-based software tool designed to assist users in the consistent acquisition, electronic storage, and submission of contextual data associated to their samples. A preconfigured Microsoft(R) Excel(R) spreadsheet is used to initiate structured contextual data storage in the field or laboratory. Each sample is given a unique identifier and at any stage the sheets can be uploaded to the MetaBar database server. To label samples, identifiers can be printed as barcodes. An intuitive web interface provides quick access to the contextual data in the MetaBar database as well as user and project management capabilities. Export functions facilitate contextual and sequence data submission to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), comprising of the DNA DataBase of Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (EMBL) and GenBank. MetaBar requests and stores contextual data in compliance to the Genomic Standards Consortium specifications. The MetaBar open source code base for local installation is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GNU GPL3). CONCLUSION: The MetaBar software supports the typical workflow from data acquisition and field-sampling to contextual data enriched sequence submission to an INSDC database. The integration with the megx.net marine Ecological Genomics database and portal facilitates georeferenced data integration and metadata-based comparisons of sampling sites as well as interactive data visualization. The ample export functionalities and the INSDC submission support enable exchange of data across disciplines and safeguarding contextual data.},

abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean +/-1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option--an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file--so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.},

abstract = {In an eye movement experiment, we examined the use of reanalysis strategies during the reading of locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous Spanish sentences. Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attach high (to the main verb of the sentence) or low (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+ 1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process as described by Frazier and Rayner (1982).},

It involves studying thousands of individuals, often from different populations, with exacting techniques. The scale and complexity of such research has required the formation of research consortia. Members of these consortia need to agree on policies for managing shared resources and handling genetic data. Here we consider data-sharing and intellectual property policies for an international research consortium working on the genomic epidemiology of malaria. We outline specific guidelines governing how samples and data are transferred among its members; how results are released into the public domain; when to seek protection for intellectual property; and how intellectual property should be managed. We outline some pragmatic solutions founded on the basic principles of promoting innovation and access.},

metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using twodifferent
grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on ﬁxation durationsand
regression probabilities in a sample of German readers’ eye movements,
thePotsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used
to quantify theeffect of surprisal while taking into account unigram
frequency and bigram frequency(transitional probability), word length,
and empirically-derived word predictability;the so-called “early”
and “late” measures of processing difﬁculty both showedan effect
of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statisticallynon-signiﬁcant
effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thusdemonstrates
the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension
difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identiﬁcationof
syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with
durations ofpost-syntactic events may be difﬁcult to uphold.},

abstract = {Many visual search experiments measure response time (RT) as their primary dependent variable. Analyses typically focus on mean (or median) RT. However, given enough data, the RT distribution can be a rich source of information. For this paper, we collected about 500 trials per cell per observer for both target-present and target-absent displays in each of three classic search tasks: feature search, with the target defined by color; conjunction search, with the target defined by both color and orientation; and spatial configuration search for a 2 among distractor 5s. This large data set allows us to characterize the RT distributions in detail. We present the raw RT distributions and fit several psychologically motivated functions (ex-Gaussian, ex-Wald, Gamma, and Weibull) to the data. We analyze and interpret parameter trends from these four functions within the context of theories of visual search.},

The benefit of Vincentizing is that the resulting histogram "looks like" an average of the individuals. In this article, we competitively test Vincentizing against the more mundane approach of averaging parameter estimates from fits to individuals. We simulate data from three distributions: the ex-Gaussian, the Weibull, and the shifted-Wald. For the ex-Gaussian and the shifted-Wald, parameter averaging outperforms Vincentizing. There is only an advantage of Vincentizing for the Weibull and only when there are few observations per participant. Overall, we recommend that researchers use Vincentizing only in select circumstances and with the knowledge that Vincentized estimates are often inconsistent estimators of averaged parameters.},

abstract = {High-throughput biological assays such as microarrays let us ask very detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us personalize therapy. Data processing, however, is often not de- scribed well enough to allow for exact reproduction of the results, leading to exercises in “forensic bioinformatics” where aspects of raw data and reported results are used to infer what methods must have been employed. Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just methods but errors. In this report, we examine several related papers purport- ing to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incor- porate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common. We then discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own investigations.},

abstract = {Numerous studies of genetic epidemiology and post-genomics in respiratory diseases rely on the use of biobanks, defined as organised biological sample collections with associated personal and clinical data. The use of biobanks is increasing and raises several ethical issues. What are the ethical trends and legal frameworks in the post-genomic era? Are there new issues in relation to the developments of techniques and new study designs? How does this affect the clinician's attitudes and relationship with the patients? The main ethical issues encountered are: informed consent; confidentiality; secondary use of samples and data over time; return of results; and data sharing. Different levels and modalities of dealing with such issues are identified and vary from legally binding measures to "soft" regulations, such as ethical recommendations by various committees or professional organisations. A further level of complexity appears with the increasing international dimension of such activities in a context in which national positions vary on those topics. There is a tension between a necessary level of diversity in ethical positions and an indispensable common pedestal of principles and procedures to manage these issues in order to foster research. Current legal and ethical trends favour the facilitation of secondary use of samples, more biobank openness, balanced with a growing attention to dialogue and public/stakeholder consultation, an increased role for research ethics committees and more sophisticated data protection and governance structures.},

However, the scales at which these laws apply are not necessarily relevant to data sharing practice among individuals (e.g., in virtual, social communities). Rather, the data sharing communities and their members often form their own policies, practices and norms governing data sharing. Using common property theory, our research objectives were to determine: (1) parallels between data sharing communities and natural resource-sharing communities; (2) factors that lead to successful data sharing; (3) circumstances under which rules, laws and policies govern data sharing. We used cases from two emerging data sharing communities in the environmental sciences—a micrometeorology community (FLUXNET) and a satellite remote sensing community. Cases of data sharing without conflict or irresolvable disputes had more principles in common with a successfully managed natural resource commons than did those characterized by conflict. Successful data sharing requires that biophysical scientists be more attentive to the social nature of data sharing.},

RESULTS: This survey reviews the latest grid technologies from the viewpoints of computing grid, data grid and knowledge grid. Computing grid technologies have been matured enough to solve high-throughput real-world life scientific problems. Data grid technologies are strong candidates for realizing "resourceome" for bioinformatics. Knowledge grids should be designed not only from sharing explicit knowledge on computers but also from community formulation for sharing tacit knowledge among a community. CONCLUSION: Extending the concept of grid from computing grid to knowledge grid, it is possible to make use of a grid as not only sharable computing resources, but also as time and place in which people work together, create knowledge, and share knowledge and experiences in a community.},

The manipulation of several factors expected to influence the probability of generating or maintaining the unlicensed interpretation resulted in 2 major age differences: Older adults were generally more likely to endorse the incorrect interpretation for sentences containing optionally transitive verbs (e.g., hunted, paid), and they showed decreased availability of the correct interpretation of subordinate clauses containing reflexive absolute transitive verbs (e.g., dress, bathe). These age differences may in part be linked to older adults' increased reli- ance on heuristic-like good-enough processing to compensate for age-related defi- cits in working memory capacity. The results support previous studies suggesting that syntactic reanalysis may not be an all-or-nothing process and might not be completed unless questions probing unresolved aspects of the sentence structure challenge the resultant interpretation.},

abstract = {Eyetracking and the self-paced moving-window reading paradigm were used in two experi- ments examining the contributions of both frequency-based verb biases and the plausibility of particular word combinations to the comprehension of temporarily ambiguous sentences. The temporary ambiguity concerned whether a noun following a verb was its direct object (The senator regretted the decision immediately.), or instead the subject of an embedded clause (The senator regretted the decision had been made public.). The experiments crossed the plausibility of the temporarily ambiguous noun as a direct object (e.g., The senator regretted the decision . . . vs The senator regretted the reporter . . with verb bias, eliminating a confound present in earlier research and allowing an examination of interactions between the two factors. Unbiased verbs were included as well to evaluate the role of plausibility in the absence of verb bias. The results generally replicated Trueswell, Tanenhaus, and Kellos (1993) finding that verb bias has rapid effects on ambiguity resolution, and showed in addition that verb bias and plausibility interact during comprehension. The results are most consistent with parallel interactive models of language comprehension such as constraint satisfaction models.},

The present article shows how one of these models, E-Z Reader (Pollatsek, Reichle, \& Rayner, 2006c), can be augmented to redress this limitation. Simulations show that with a few simple assumptions, the model can account for the fact that effects of higher level language processing are not observed on eye movements when such processing is occurring without difficulty, but can capture the patterns of eye movements that are observed when such processing is slowed or disrupted.},

- does strategy-use account for differences in ospan?
> although normatively effective strategies were self-reported on only a small proportion of OSPAN sets, individual differences in effective strategy use correlated with span per- formance
> individual differences in effective strategy use did not mediate the relationship between OSPAN and measures of verbal ability

        
intro
- Hasher and colleagues argue that individual differences in span reflect the degree to which people inhibit irrelevant, or no-longer-relevant, information from WM when performing the task (e.g., Lustig, May, \{\&\} Hasher, 2001; May, Hasher, \{\&\} Kane, 1999)
- Engle and his colleagues suggest that variability in span performance derives from indi- vidual differences in attention control capabilities that are critical to both active maintenance and inhibition
- all emphasize that WM capacity differences---as measured by WM span---largely reflect the integrity of general pro- cesses or mechanisms that are central to the WM system (Conway, Kane, \{\&\} Engle, 2003).
- examine third theory: individual differences that arise in WM span are readily explained in terms of variability in some relatively general mechanism but, in principle, they can be equally well accounted for by differences in strategic behaviour
- differences in span performance are assumed to result from variability in the algorithms, or strategies, that individuals use while performing span tasks
- strategy instructions (turly-ames \{\&\} whitfield 2003), as well as more intensive training in the use of a particular strategy (McNamara \{\&\} Scott, 2001), significantly boosted span scores
- engle, cantor \{\&\} carullo (1992) and friedman \{\&\} miyake (2004): Viewing time on the to-be-remembered words correlated significantly with span performance (r 1⁄4 .29), suggesting that high-WM individuals read (or studied, or rehearsed) the target words for more time than did low-WM individuals

        
the study
- rather than allowing participants to pace themselves through the task, in our studies (as in most) the experimenter controlled the stimulus presentation
- participants who used the imagery-based strategy earned higher span scores than did those who did not in friedman \{\&\} miyake (2004)
- set-by-set: after each set question for strategy (exp. 1)
- retrospective: first all sets, then question for each set (exp. 1 and 2)
- set-by-set reliable and without influence on performance and/or strategy-use in the task
- set-by-set reports demonstrate acceptable validity and have minimal reactive effects on task processing when they are used to measure strategy use in related domains, such as in associative learning and free recall
- If strategy use accounts for individual differ- ences in span performance, then the correlation between the use of effective strategies and span performance will be positive.

        
exp 1
- two groups: retro. and set-by-set and retro-only
- to achieve greater statistical power for analyses relevant to the strategy mediation hypothesis, we collapsed across the two groups and analysed retrospective reports where appropriate
- first general report without suggestions, then set-by-set retrospective
- The OSPAN task was scored by calculating the percentage of items in each set that were recalled in correct serial position and then averaging these percentages across sets (PCU)
- mostly just reading the word, effective strategy on over 20\%, less effective on \~{}33\%
- 30\% only reading or rehearsing, only 63\% at least one effective strategy
- "Thus, although indi- viduals were strategic in some cases, widespread use of normatively effective strategies was not evident, with close to 70\% of the participants using them on fewer than a third of the trials."
- Given that retrospective reports could not have reactive effects on the OSPAN task (because they occurred after the OSPAN task had been performed), we used them exclusively in Experiment 2.
- as expected, span performance was higher when participants reported using mediational strategies that involved associating the to-be-remembered words within a set than when they just read the words or used more passive rehearsal strategies.
- general reports: span performance was not consistently greater across groups when participants reported that they had used a more effective strategy than a less effective one
- if all we had available were these general reports, we would conclude that participants' strategies in OSPAN had no relation to their performance!!!
- strategy reports significantly predicted OSPAN scores, such that trials on which participants reported using a normatively effective strategy yielded higher recall than did trials on which participants reported using a normatively ineffective strategy

        
exp. 2
- replicate findings and to allow more complete evaluation of strategy mediation hypothesis
- concurrent set-by-set reports were dropped in favour of retrospective reports
- to investigate whether strategy use can account for any span-- ability relationships, each participant also com- pleted three standard measures of cognitive (verbal) ability, which included tests of analogical reasoning and reading comprehension.
- Verbal Analogies, Reading Comprehension, and Inference); the first two were modified from the originals by presenting only a subset of items
- The major meth- odological change was that all set-by-set reports were made retrospectively.
- set-by-set reports had construct validity, accounted for varia- bility in span performance, and were more highly related to span performance than were general reports
- 24\% only rehearsal/reading, 71\% at least one effective strategy
- although individ- uals were strategic in some cases, widespread use of effective strategies was not evident, with over 50\% of the participants using them on fewer than a third of the trials.
- The proportion correct on the span task was significantly greater for normatively effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .70, Mdn 1⁄4 .73, SEM 1⁄4 .03) than for the normatively less effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .61, Mdn 1⁄4 .62, SEM 1⁄4 .02), t(67) 1⁄4 2.90, p , .05.
- several diverse sources of evidence demonstrate the empirical validity of the strategy-as-effect account

        
Across two experiments, individual differences in effective strategy use were evident. As important, these differences sig- nificantly correlated with performance on the span task. These outcomes confirm a critical prediction of the strategy mediation hypothesis.

        
Turley-Ames and Whitfield (2003) found that high-WM participants benefited little when instructed to use rehearsal, imagery, or semantic-chaining strategies during OSPAN, because they appeared to have been performing optimally in the pretest, prior to any instruction.

        
individual differences in WM capacity may afford the use of strategies, which in turn can contribute to span scores},

This theory grew out of the dynamic systems approach to motor control and development, and is grounded in neural principles. The initial application of dynamic field theory to issues in visuo-spatial cognition extended concepts of the motor approach to decision making in a sensori-motor context, and, more recently, to the dynamics of spatial cognition. Here we extend these concepts still further to address topics in visual cognition, including visual working memory for non-spatial object properties, the processes that underlie change detection, and the 'binding problem' in vision. In each case, we demonstrate that the general principles of the dynamic field approach can unify findings in the literature and generate novel predictions. We contend that the application of these concepts to visual cognition avoids the pitfalls of reductionist approaches in cognitive science, and points toward a formal integration of brains, bodies, and behavior.},

abstract = {For many researchers, eye-movement measures have become instrumental in revealing the moment-to-moment activity of the mind during reading. In general, there has been a great deal of consistency across studies within the eye-movement literature, and researchers have discovered and examined many variables involved in the reading process that affect the nature of readers' eye movements. Despite remarkable progress, however, there are still a number of issues to be resolved. In this article, we discuss three controversial issues: (1) the extent to which eye-movement behavior is affected by low-level oculomotor factors versus higher-level cognitive processes; (2) how much information is extracted from the right of fixation; and (3) whether readers process information from more than one word at a time.},

abstract = {When participants are asked to respond in the same way to stimuli from different sources (e.g., auditory and visual), responses are often observed to be substantially faster when both stimuli are presented simultaneously (redundancy gain). Different models account for this effect, the two most important being race models and coactivation models. Redundancy gains consistent with the race model have an upper limit, however, which is given by the well-known race model inequality (Miller, 1982). A number of statistical tests have been proposed for testing the race model inequality in single participants and groups of participants. All of these tests use the race model as the null hypothesis, and rejection of the null hypothesis is considered evidence in favor of coactivation. We introduce a statistical test in which the race model prediction is the alternative hypothesis. This test controls the Type I error if a theory predicts that the race model prediction holds in a given experimental condition.},

Using both offline and online methods, we show that the processing of pronominal object-relative clauses is influenced by the frequency of co-occurrence of the word combinations (chunks) forming the clause. We use materials that are controlled for capacity-based factors that have been previously shown to influence comprehension of relative clauses. The results suggest that, other factors being equal, the frequency of the word chunk forming the clause affects processing difficulty. Analyses of the data indicate that the results cannot be explained by differential access to individual lexical items. Following recent constructivist approaches, we argue that frequency of co-occurrence influences the chunking mechanism by which multiword sequences may become fused into processing units that are easier to access.},

abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are usually assumed to be directed to locations
containing important or useful information, but such assumptions
fail to take into account that planning saccades to such locations
might be too costly in terms of effort or attention required. To
investigate costs of saccadic planning, subjects searched for a target
letter that was contained in either one of two clusters located on
either side of a central fixation target. A target was present on
each trial and was more likely (probability=0.8) to appear in one
cluster than the other. Probabilities were disclosed by differences
in cluster intensities. The distance between each cluster and central
fixation varied (60'-300'). The presentation time was limited (500
ms) to ensure that a successful search would require a wisely chosen
saccadic plan. The best chance of finding the target would be to
direct the first saccade to the high-probability location, but only
one of the six subjects tested followed this strategy consistently.
The rest (to varying degrees) preferred to aim the first saccade
to the closer location, often followed by an attempted search of
the remaining location. Two-location searches were unsuccessful;
performance at both locations was poor due to insufficient time.
Preferences for such ineffective strategies were surprising. They
suggest that saccadic plans were influenced by attempts to minimize
the cognitive and attentional load attached to planning and to maximize
the number of new foveal views that can be acquired in a limited
period of time. These strategies, though disastrous in our task,
may be crucial in natural scanning, when many cognitive operations
are performed at once, and the risk attached to a few errant glances
at unimportant places is small.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to formulate a professional and scientific view on the social, ethical, and legal issues that impact on data storage and DNA banking practices for biomedical research in Europe. Many aspects have been considered, such as the requirements for data storage and DNA banking in the public and private sectors in Europe and the issues relating to DNA banking, that is to say the consent requirements for the banking and further uses of DNA samples, their control and ownership, and the return of benefit derived from DNA exploitation to the community. The methods comprise primarily the review of the existing professional guidelines, legal frameworks and other documents related to the data storage and DNA banking practices in public and private sectors in Europe. Then, the issues related to DNA banking were examined during an international workshop organized by the European Society of Human Genetics Public and Professional Policy Committee in Paris, France, 07-08, April, 2000. A total of 50 experts from 12 European countries attended this workshop. It came out that DNA banking for medical and research purposes is indispensable. It facilitates the constitution of large collections, sharing of samples, multiple testing on the same samples, and repeating testing over the years. However, banking organization is complex, requires multiple actors, and concerns are expressed in various countries. International standardization of ethical requirements and policies with regard to DNA banking has been recommended. Such standardization would facilitate a greater protection of individuals as well as future international cooperation in biomedical research.},

abstract = {While much work has been done investigating the role of context in the incremental processing of syntactic indeterminacies, relatively little is known about online semantic interpretation. The experiments in this article made use of the eye-tracking paradigm with spoken language and visual contexts in order to examine how, and when listeners make use of contextually-defined contrast in interpreting simple prenominal adjectives. Experiment 1 focused on intersective adjectives. Experiment 1A provided further evidence that intersective adjectives are processed incrementally. Experiment 1B compared response times to follow instructions such as 'Pick up the blue comb' under conditions where there were two blue objects (e.g. a blue pen and a blue comb), but only one of these objects had a contrasting member in the display. Responses were faster to objects with a contrasting member, establishing that the listeners initially assume a contrastive interpretation for intersective adjectives. Experiments 2 and 3 focused on vague scalar adjectives examining the time course with which listeners establish contrast for scalar adjectives such as tall using information provided by the head noun (e.g. glass) and information provided by the visual context. Use of head-based information was examined by manipulating the typicality of the target object (e.g. whether it was a good or poor example of a tall glass. Use of context-dependent contrast was examined by either having only a single glass in the display (the no contrast condition) or a contrasting object (e.g. a smaller glass). The pattern of results indicated that listeners interpreted the scalar adjective incrementally taking into account context-specific contrast prior to encountering the head. Moreover, the presence of a contrasting object, sharply reduced, and in some conditions completely eliminated, typicality effects. The results suggest a language processing system in which semantic interpretation, as well as syntactic processing, is conducted incrementally, with early integration of contextual information.},

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the spatial direction of endogenous covert spatial attention in one sensory modality can crossmodally influence early processing of stimuli in a different modality. However, spatial locations are initially coded according to different frames of reference for different modalities (e.g., body-centered for touch versus retinocentric vision) and postural changes (e.g., gaze shifts) will realign these. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how the direction of endogenous tactile attention affects sensory-specific visual ERP components. Critically, by manipulating direction of gaze, we were able to test whether any crossmodal effects depend on visual and tactile projections to a common hemisphere, on common locations in external space, or on some combination of the two. We found that both P1 and N1 visual components were modulated according to the direction of endogenous tactile attention. While the P1 crossmodal effect followed purely hemispheric constraints, the attentional modulation of N1 appeared to combine both anatomical and external spatial constraints.},

abstract = {Research on shallow processing suggests that readers sometimes encode only a superficial representation of a text and fail to make use of all available information. Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff (1992) extended this work to pronouns, finding evidence that readers sometimes fail to automatically identify referents even when these are unambiguous. In this paper we revisit those findings. In 11 recognition probe, priming, and self-report experiments, we manipulated Greene et al.'s stories to discover under what circumstances a pronoun's referent is automatically understood. We lengthened the stories from 4 to 8 lines. This simple manipulation led to automatic and correct resolution, which we attribute to readers' increased engagement with the stories. We found evidence of resolution even when the additional text did not mention the pronoun's referent. In addition, our results suggest that the pronoun temporarily boosts the referent's accessibility, an advantage that disappears by the end of the next sentence. Finally, we present evidence from memory experiments that supports complete pronoun resolution for the longer but not the shorter stories.

abstract = {This paper reports results from a self-paced reading study in Chinese that demonstrates that object-extracted relative clause structures are less complex than corresponding subject-extracted structures. These results contrast with results from processing other Subject-Verb-Object languages like English, in which object-extracted structures are more complex than subject-extracted structures. A key word-order difference between Chinese and other Subject-Verb-Object languages is that Chinese relative clauses precede their head nouns. Because of this word order difference, the results follow from a resource-based theory of sentence complexity, according to which there is a storage cost associated with predicting syntactic heads in order to form a grammatical sentence. The results are also consistent with a theory according to which people have less difficulty processing embedded clauses whose word order matches the word order in main clauses. Some corpus analyses of Chinese texts provide results that constrain the classes of possible frequency-based theories. Critically, these results demonstrate that there is nothing intrinsically easy about extracting from subject position: depending on the word order in the main clause and in a relative clause, extraction from object position can be easier to process in some circumstances.},

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by [Jordan, 1986] which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

"While Anna dressed the baby played in the crib") as indicated by
their responding "Yes" to questions probing the initial, syntactically
unlicensed interpretation (e.g., "Did Anna dress the baby?"). The
manipulation of several factors expected to influence the probability
of generating or maintaining the unlicensed interpretation resulted
in 2 major age differences: Older adults were generally more likely
to endorse the incorrect interpretation for sentences containing
optionally transitive verbs (e.g., hunted, paid), and they showed
decreased availability of the correct interpretation of subordinate
clauses containing reflexive absolute transitive verbs (e.g., dress,
bathe). These age differences may in part be linked to older adults'
increased reliance on heuristic-like good-enough processing to compensate
for age-related deficits in working memory capacity. The results
support previous studies suggesting that syntactic reanalysis may
not be an all-or-nothing process and might not be completed unless
questions probing unresolved aspects of the sentence structure challenge
the resultant interpretation.},

correlates well with other measures of WM capacity and has both good
internal consistency (alpha = .78) and test–retest reliability (.83).
In addition, the automated version of Ospan (Aospan) was shown to
load on the same factor as two other WM measures. This WM capacity
factor correlated with a factor composed of fluid abilities measures.
The utility of the Aospan was further demonstrated by analyzing response
times (RTs) that indicated that RT measures obtained in the task
accounted for additional variance in predicting fluid abilities.
Our results suggest that Aospan is a reliable and valid indicator
of WM capacity that can be applied to a wide array of research domains.},

role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in

a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways

more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing
with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions
to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them
from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting
the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction
of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows,
sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in
its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation
is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed
by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops.
Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed.

abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context.},

In this article, we report the results of two eye-tracking studies of Korean prenominal relative clauses that confirm a processing advantage for subject relatives both with and without supporting context. These results are shown to be compatible with accounts involving the accessibility hierarchy (Keenan \& Comrie 1977), phrase-structural complexity (OGrady 1997), and probabilistic structural disambiguation (Mitchell et al. 1995, Hale 2006), partially compatible with similarity-based interference (Gordon et al. 2001), but incompatible with linear/temporal analyses of filler-gap dependencies (Gibson 1998, 2000, Lewis \& Vasishth 2005, Lewis et al. 2006).},

abstract = {The inhibition of return (IOR) phenomenon is routinely considered an effect of reflexive attention because the paradigm used to generate IOR employs peripheral cues that are uninformative as to where a target will appear. Because the cues are spatially unreliable it is thought that there is no reason for attention to be committed volitionally to them, and hence, the IOR effect is considered reflexive. What has been generally overlooked, however, is that the cues provide reliable temporal information as to when a target will occur. This predictive information is used by participants to prepare volitionally for when a target is likely to appear. We investigated whether the IOR effect is a product of the volitional application of attention to peripheral cues for the use of their temporal information. To test this idea we rendered the temporal information provided by peripheral cues unreliable. While this eliminated participants using the cues volitionally, it did not abolish the IOR phenomenon. These data demonstrate two new findings. First, the IOR effect is fundamentally a reflexive phenomenon. Second, when peripheral cues are not used volitionally, the IOR effect is attenuated. Together, the present findings indicate that the IOR effect can be modulated by volitional (top-down) processes but it is not the product of them. We argue that an intimate link between fronto-parietal regions and the superior colliculus provide a functional neural mechanism for this volitional effect to impact IOR.},

In the localisation task, responses were determined by the visual hemifield where this singleton was presented. In the discrimination task, they were determined by the singletons' shape. While an N2pc component was elicited in an identical fashion in both tasks, a subsequent sustained contralateral negativity was consistently present at posterior sites in the discrimination task only. This dissociation demonstrates that these two activations reflect distinct visual processing stages. We suggest that while the N2pc reflects the ability of the visual system both to identify and localise a relevant stimulus in the scene, the late sustained activity reflects the subsequent in-depth analysis and identification of these stimuli.},

Recent findings suggest that they are integrated into 'object files', episodic bindings of object-related information. However, the problem of integrating distributed codes is not restricted to perception but applies to action planning and sensorimotor processing as well. Here I argue that the brain addresses these problems by creating multi-layered networks of bindings - 'event files' - that temporarily link codes of perceptual events, the current task context, and the actions performed therein. These bindings produce systematic but often surprising and counter-intuitive interactions between, and impairments in, perception and action planning.},

abstract = {This target article discusses the verbal working memory system used
in sentence comprehension. We review the concept of working memory
as a short-duration system in which small amounts of information
are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of accomplishing
a task. We summarize the argument that syntactic processing in sentence
comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We
then ask whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing
is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks that involve
conscious controlled processing. Evidence is brought to bear from
various sources: the relationship between individual differences
in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of
syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load
on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with
poor short-term memory, patients with poor working memory, and patients
with aphasia. Experimental results from these normal subjects and
patients with various brain lesions converge on the conclusion that
there is a specialization in the verbal working memory system for
assigning the syntactic structure of a sentence and using that structure
in determining sentence meaning that is separate from the working
memory system underlying the use of sentence meaning to accomplish
other functions. We present a theory of the divisions of the verbal
working memory system and suggestions regarding its neural basis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving health in our nation requires strengthening four major domains of the health care system: personal health management, health care delivery, public health, and health-related research. Many avoidable shortcomings in the health sector that result in poor quality are due to inaccessible data, information, and knowledge. A national health information infrastructure (NHII) offers the connectivity and knowledge management essential to correct these shortcomings. Better health and a better health system are within our reach. DISCUSSION: A national health information infrastructure for the United States should address the needs of personal health management, health care delivery, public health, and research. It should also address relevant global dimensions (e.g., standards for sharing data and knowledge across national boundaries). The public and private sectors will need to collaborate to build a robust national health information infrastructure, essentially a 'paperless' health care system, for the United States. The federal government should assume leadership for assuring a national health information infrastructure as recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Progress is needed in the areas of funding, incentives, standards, and continued refinement of a privacy (i.e., confidentiality and security) framework to facilitate personal identification for health purposes. Particular attention should be paid to NHII leadership and change management challenges. SUMMARY: A national health information infrastructure is a necessary step for improved health in the U.S. It will require a concerted, collaborative effort by both public and private sectors.},

To this end we use event-related potentials to examine the implementation of anaphoric links established between pronouns and non commanding antecedents (discourse- based dependency) and contrast that with the processing of anaphoric links to commanding antecedents (syntax-only dependency). The experimental results obtained show a N400-like effect associated with the formation of the pronoun-non-commanding antecedent dependency. This enhanced negativity for pronouns resolved to non-commanding antecedents supports our hypothesis that discourse-based processes place different computational demands on the comprehension system than syntax-only processes. This kind of evidence is thus consistent with models of pronominal representation whereby antecedents are established by both syntactic and non-syntactic means.},

abstract = {Computational neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that develops models to integrate complex experimental data in order to understand brain function. To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008. These include electrophysiology and behavioral (eye movement) data described towards the end of this article.},

abstract = {The impact of intellectual property rights on the production, diffusion and accumulation of scientific knowledge has been a central concern of public policymakers and economists in both public and private institutions, and scholars in management economics and sociology. In this dissertation, I examine the central patenting debates over the role of patenting the life sciences and address a set of interrelated questions: (1) the impact of strategic intellectual property policies of institutions on their cumulative knowledge dissemination, utilization and commercialization; (2) the unique attributes of life science innovations captured by patents generated under different institutional settings; and (3) the degree to which patenting activities impact the rate and trajectories of scientific knowledge accumulation under varying intellectual property conditions. I take as my research setting, the Human Genome Project (HGP) and our mapping of the entire human genome that emerged from the project (as defined in both scientific publications and patents). The HGP was a 13-year, \$3.8 billion research effort funded and coordinated by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health, and one of the most significant life science research projects ever undertaken. (cont.) To address the first question, I study the seven key genome centers in the HGP, which produced almost all the genome sequence output and provide an unusually matched and well-controlled natural experiment to examine the impact of different knowledge institutions on the subsequent diffusion of scientific knowledge. To explore the second question, I build on the data set of the population of 4270 gene patents to systematically quantify and analyze the important attributes of these gene-based innovations. Through the construction of a set of validated measures, I specifically characterize the variation in these innovations when made under public versus private institutional settings and compare them to the innovations across broad technology fields from previous studies. To answer the third question, I identify and construct a large-scale, novel data set of 1279 unique patent-paper pairs from the gene patents and apply econometric models to shed light on the degree to which patent grant in the life sciences impacts the rate of follow-on scientific research. I find that publications with matched patent pairs are associated with higher citations on the average. Since only an institutional policy allowing patents results in patents, such policy does not stifle cumulative knowledge dissemination and use. In addition, patents contribute to technological innovation, commercialization and start-up. (cont.) Furthermore, I identified a growing convergence of public/academic and industry innovations in the life sciences especially in terms of their "basicness" and appropriability as characterized by the Pasteur's quadrant, and that variation in institutional setting is associated with differential innovation characteristics. I also find evidence of "technological trajectories", coherence and persistence across various attributes of life science innovations. However, I determine that gene patenting impedes temporal knowledge diffusion and use and decreases citations of paired publications once they are granted and become "visible" to the public, as predicted by the anti-commons effect. I also ascertain that patenting hinders knowledge diffusion and use to a greater degree on private sector authored publications than public ones and for U.S. authored than non-U.S. authored ones, and that corporate patenting has a more adverse impact than public institution patenting. As the first study of its kind to directly test the "patent thicket" conceptualization, I find direct statistical evidence of the adverse effect of "patent thickets" and that the patenting of disease and cancer genes negatively impacts knowledge dissemination and use by follow-on scientists and researchers.},

abstract = {The dynamics of the allocation of attention during the preparation of saccadic eye movements was studied in a dual task paradigm. As the primary task, participants had to perform a saccade to letter-like items arranged on a clock face. The secondary task was a 2AFC discrimination task in which a discrimination target (DT) ('E' or '3') was presented among distractors, either at the saccade goal, or at a spatially separate, precued location. In the first experiment, the position of the DT was kept constant within an experimental block, while the saccade target location varied. In the second experiment, the location of the DT was varied while the saccade target remained the same within a block. The data demonstrate that attentional dynamics differs between the experiments--attention can shift to the saccade goal early or late during the saccade preparation period, depending on the task. Immediately before saccade onset, however, discrimination performance at the location of the saccade target is always superior to other locations, arguing for a strict and selective coupling between saccade preparation and attention.},

the search grid cell having the largest a priori probability.Frequent
computations of local effectiveness probabilities (LEPs) were carried
out on scene during the search and were used to determine an updated
(a posteriori) target location distribution. This distribution formed
the basis for recommendation of the current high probability areas
for search.The sum of LEPs weighted by the a priori target location
probabilties is called search effectiveness (SEP) and was used as
the overall measure of efffectiveness for the operation. SEP and
LEPs were used previously in the Mediterranean H-bomb search.On-scene
and stateside operations analysis are discussed and the progress
of the search is indicated by values of SEP for various periods during

@article{Fodor1998,
abstract = {A strong claim about human sentence comprehension is that the processing
mechanism is fully innate and applies differently to different languages
only to the extent that their grammars differ. If so, there is hope
for an explanatory project which attributes all parsing “strategies”
to fundamental design characteristics of the parsing device. However,
the whole explanatory program is in peril because of the discovery
(Cuetos \& Mitchell, 1988) that Late Closure is not universal: Spanish,
and also Dutch and other languages, favor Early Closure (high attachment)
where English favors Late Closure flow attachment). I argue that
the universal parser can weather this storm. Exceptions to Late Closure
in Spanish and other languages are observed only in one construction
(a relative clause attaching into a complex noun phrase [NP]), which
is borderline in English too. For other constructions, low attachment
is preferred in all languages tested. I propose that what differentiates
the complex NP construction is the heaviness of the attachee compared
to that of the host configuration. A relative clause is a heavy attachee,
and the lower NP alone is small as a host; the relative is therefore
better balanced if the whole complex NP is its host. A wide range
of facts is accounted for by the principle that a constituent likes
to have a sister of its own size. Light constituents will tend to
attach low, and heavy ones to attach high, since larger constituents
are dominated by higher nodes. A preference for balanced weight is
familiar from work on prosodic phrasing. I suggest, therefore, that
prosodic processing occurs in parallel with syntactic processing
(even in reading) and influences structural ambiguity resolution.
Height of attachment ambiguities are resolved by the prosodically
motivated same-size-sister constraint. The exceptional behavior of
English may be due to its prosodic packaging of a relative pronoun
with the adjacent noun, overriding the balance tendency. If this
explanation is correct, it is possible that all cross-language variations
in parsing preferences are due to cross-language variations in the
prosodic component of the competence grammar.ER -},

abstract = {We propose that, for the human parser, recovery from garden paths
consists in repairing the structure built so far, rather than reparsing
the input. The difficulty of a repair is attributable not to the
cost of effecting the structural alterations but to the cost of deducing
which alterations are needed. The parser must diagnose its error
in order to correct it. The error is signaled by an input word that
is incompatible with the current structure; this is the symptom from
which the diagnosis must be made. If the error is transparently clear
from the nature of the symptom, recovery is easy; but sometimes the
necessary reasoning is obscure, and then the diagnosis is unsuccessful
and the garden path persists. Unlike other repair models, the diagnosis
model needs no special mechanism for revising garden path analyses.
The garden path recovery device is the same machine as the first-pass
parser, merely set into emergency mode. When faced with a breakdown
the parser does not stop its normal activities and enter a new mode
of reasoning to detect what went wrong. It simply continues to parse,
attaching the problematic input item in the least ungrammatical way
it can, despite the conflict with previously built structure. This
conflict is productive; it provokes adjustments to the existing structure.
In successful cases, one adjustment leads to another until a stable
state is reached, at which point the original error will have been
eliminated. Examples suggest that the parser gives more weight to
syntatctic than to pragmatic acceptability; only a syntactic clash
between the input and the existing structure sets the adjustment
process in motion.ER -},

Infants' differential looking to conceptually implausible/impossible

many areas, including object knowledge, physics, language, and number.
However, an event's plausibility is commonly confounded with its
perceptual novelty or familiarity, leading to a variety of interpretations
for looking time data (Bogartz, Shinskey \& Speaker, 1997). This
illustrative study demonstrates the value of factorial designs, in
which perceptual (novelty-familiarity) and conceptual (possible-impossible)
variables are independently and jointly explored. It also introduces
pupil dilation as a viable and complementary dependent measure to
study infant cognition. We show that pupil data can assist in the
interpretation of otherwise equivocal looking time data. The discussion

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

abstract = {For lexical-gustatory synaesthetes, words trigger automatic, associated food sensations (e.g., for JB, the word slope tastes of over-ripe melon). Our study tests two claims about this unusual condition: that synaesthetic tastes are associated with abstract levels of word representation (concepts/lemmas), and that the first tastes to crystallise in early development are those triggered by food-names (e.g., apple tastes of apple; Simner \{\&\} Ward, 2006). This concept/lemma-based proposal is difficult to immediately reconcile with the finding that non-words may also generate tastes (Ward, Simner, \{\&\} Auyeung, 2005), since non-words have no concept/lemma representations. We manipulated the characteristics of non-words to provide three types of evidence that non-word tastes in fact stem from real word neighbours: Non-words with neighbours (e.g., keach) are more likely to generate tastes than those with no neighbours (e.g., vilps); pseudo-homophone non-words that are orthographically close to real words (e.g., peeple) are more likely to generate tastes than those that are more distant (baybee); and finally, the tastes of non-words are less consistent, and less intense, than those of real words. Additionally, we test the hypothesis that synaesthetic tastes develop initially from food-names by showing that non-words are more intensely flavoured if they are homophonic with food-names (e.g., toffie) versus non-foods (e.g., peeple). From this we conclude that synaesthetic tastes develop from food-names, and that tasty non-words do not challenge a concept/lemma-based account of lexical-gustatory synaesthesia.},

abstract = {Orientation tuning of neurons is one of the chief emergent characteristics
of the primary visual cortex, V1. Neurons of the lateral geniculate
nucleus, which comprise the thalamic input to V1, are not orientation-tuned,
but the majority of V1 neurons are quite selective. How orientation
tuning arises within V1 is still controversial. To study this problem,
we measured how the orientation tuning of neurons evolves with time
using a new method: reverse correlation in the orientation domain.
Orientation tuning develops after a delay of 30-45 milliseconds and
persists for 40-85 ms. Neurons in layers 4C alpha or 4C beta, which
receive direct input from the thalamus, show a single orientation
preference which remains unchanged throughout the response period.
In contrast, the preferred orientations of output layer neurons (in
layers 2, 3, 4B, 5 or 6) usually change with time, and in many cases
the orientation tuning may have more than one peak. This difference
in dynamics is accompanied by a change in the sharpness of orientation
tuning; cells in the input layers are more broadly tuned than cells
in the output layers. Many of these observed properties of output
layer neurons cannot be explained by simple feedforward models, whereas
they arise naturally in feedback networks. Our results indicate that
V1 is more than a bank of static oriented filters; the dynamics of
output layer cells appear to be shaped by intracortical feedback.},

Building on the well-established motivation--opportunity--ability (MOA) framework, we posit that knowledge sharing among 
employees is a function of their MOA to do so. Existing literature suggests that the interaction among motivation, opportunity, and 
ability drives knowledge-sharing behavior. In contrast, we specify a new model in which the ``bottleneck'' or constraining factor 
among the MOA variables determines the degree of knowledge sharing that occurs. This constraining-factor model (CFM) fits the 
data better than the traditional multiplicative model and reveals a new, qualitatively different portrait of knowledge sharing that 
resolves some of the puzzles in the previous literature. The CFM provides macro-level insights with respect to how operations 
managers can improve employee knowledge sharing by focusing on the bottleneck MOA variable. As a result, the CFM can help set 
strategic directions of related policies. The model emphasizes that, counter to conventional wisdom, the MOA variables should not 
be addressed independently, but rather in a dynamic and coordinated way. },

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity.

abstract = {In recent years, scientific disciplines related to global, environmental problem solving have been a special target of data sharing efforts. Yet, very little research exists to guide the organization of scientific data sources or to understand the technical and social infrastructures needed to support the secondary use of data. Ecology is one of the disciplines that contributes to our knowledge of the natural world, but several factors complicate the sharing and reuse of ecological data. I conducted in-depth interviews to investigate the experiences of ecologists who used data they did not collect themselves in order to understand how they overcome these challenges. My findings extend our knowledge of information reuse, and they have implications for the design of digital libraries, for the development of standards, and for the creation of data sharing policies and programs. Fieldwork performs an important function in shaping ecologists' formal and informal knowledge, which carries over to their reuse of data. The informal knowledge ecologists acquire as collectors of their own data in the field or laboratory plays the most important role in their reuse of data. The secondary use of data on a large scale requires a greater emphasis on standardization, peer review, and quality control, which alters the extent of reliance on informal knowledge. However, a formal system offers only some of the information that scientists require to reuse data, and there is a danger in thinking that informal knowledge is easily replaced and is no longer necessary or important. My study shows how social exchange is an integral part of all scientific understanding. Standard research methods, metadata standards, and common storage formats make it possible to integrate data on a large scale, but this power comes from leaving out information that is necessary to secondary data use. Ecology teaches us that there are multiple sides to issues of trust, standards, understanding, and judgments about data quality. To be effective vehicles of data sharing, digital libraries and data repositories must capture public and private knowledge and must find ways to document the implicit knowledge that ecologists recognize and can articulate.},

It is the objective of this paper to shortly describe this approach, and to analyse how openEHR archetypes impact on health professionals and semantic interoperability. METHODS: Analysis of current approaches to EHR systems, terminology and standards developments. In addition to literature reviews, we organised face-to-face and additional telephone interviews and tele-conferences with members of relevant organisations and committees. RESULTS: The openEHR archetypes approach enables syntactic interoperability and semantic interpretability -- both important prerequisites for semantic interoperability. Archetypes enable the formal definition of clinical content by clinicians. To enable comprehensive semantic interoperability, the development and maintenance of archetypes needs to be coordinated internationally and across health professions. Domain knowledge governance comprises a set of processes that enable the creation, development, organisation, sharing, dissemination, use and continuous maintenance of archetypes. It needs to be supported by information technology. CONCLUSIONS: To enable EHRs, semantic interoperability is essential. The openEHR archetypes approach enables syntactic interoperability and semantic interpretability. However, without coordinated archetype development and maintenance, 'rank growth' of archetypes would jeopardize semantic interoperability. We therefore believe that openEHR archetypes and domain knowledge governance together create the knowledge environment required to adopt EHRs.},

two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herself

        
Intrusion occurs when speakers retrieve non-target or structurally inappro- priate items that share some measure of similarity with the appro- priate target.

        
Badecker and Straub (2002) and Kennison (2003) have found that inaccessible antecedents exerted an influence on the resolution of reflexives and pronouns.

        
previous studies have investigated intrusion effects in very different constructions, such as wh-questions, pronoun binding, subject-verb agreement, and licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) such as any, ever, or lift a finger

        
At first glance NPI licensing shares important commonalities with the processing of anaphora, and with reflexives in particular. Both phenomena typically require a licensor in a structurally appropriate position.

        
the human parser can use structural constraints to guide its operations

        
a number of studies indicate that when completing a wh-dependency, com- prehenders are sensitive to island constraints, such that the well-known `active' gap construction mechanisms are inoperative in domains that span island boundaries (e.g., Phillips, 2006; Stowe, 1986; Traxler \{\&\} Pickering, 1996)

        
A particularly relevant example for this study is an eye-tracking study by Sturt (2003) on the processing of reflexives like himself and herself, which demonstrated a retrieval mechanism that appears to immediately respect grammatical constraints on antecedents for reflexives.

        
responses in the inaccessible licensor condition were both slower and less accurate than in the other two conditions

        
an N400 component was elicited in both ungrammatical conditions

        
Vasishth et al. (2008) demonstrated faster reading times for sentences with an intrusive licensor than for sentences with no licensor, but only in later reading time measures such as second pass fixations.

        
Vasishth, Lewis and their col- leagues (Lewis, Vasishth, \{\&\} Van Dyke, 2006; Vasishth, Drenhaus, Saddy, \{\&\} Lewis, 2005) have argued that the intrusion effect in NPI licensing reflects a general cue-based memory retrieval mechanism that is sensitive to partial cue overlap

        
(7a) shows that when an NPI is within the semantic scope of a negation, it can be licensed, even though it is not syntactically c-commanded by the negation. (7b) shows that the same is not true of reflexive binding, which requires the antecedent to c-command the reflexive.

        
There is a broad consensus among current leading theories of neg- ative polarity phenomena that NPI licensing reflects an interaction between the lexical properties of NPIs and the semantics and prag- matics of entire propositions (e.g., Chierchia, 2006; Fauconnier, 1975; Giannakidou, 1998; Israel, 2004; Kadmon \{\&\} Landman, 1993; Krifka, 1995; Ladusaw, 1992), rather than a direct structural relation between the NPI and a licensing item.

        
much work in linguistics suggests that NPI licensing and reflexive binding involve substantially different relations. Specifically, whereas reflexive binding involves depen- dencies between two specific syntactic constituents, many stud- ies of NPI licensing have concluded that NPIs are licensed by the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions, rather than involving dependencies with specific lexical items.

        
Since the reflexive binding relation is more easily classified as an item-to-item dependency it may be a better candidate for testing the predictions of a retrieval-based model such as ACT-R.

        
The contrasting findings about NPI licensing and reference resolution may reflect the different methodologies that have been used across studies, or they may reflect fundamental differences in the two phenomena

        
In this study, we compared the intrusion effect on NPI licensing and reflexive binding in the same structural configurations and in the same experiment, using ERP recordings, which offer a fine-grained and continuous measure of brain activity.

        
two types of unac- ceptable sentence. The first type of unacceptable sentence con- tained no potential licensor for the NPI or reflexive, and the second type of unacceptable sentence contained a potential licen- sor in a structurally inappropriate position

        
The two intrusive conditions included the same potential NPI licensors, but in the subject position of the relative clause.

        
if the intrusive licensing effect appears in the ERP re- cord as soon as any effect of ungrammaticality, then we may con- clude that intrusion impedes the ability of speakers to detect grammatical errors, making a true `illusion of grammaticality'

        
Since overt negation is a stereotypical licensor for NPIs, it is possible that intrusive licensing might reflect the high cooccurrence frequency between no and ever.

        
Previous studies have shown that gender-stereo- typed nouns cause comprehender to make an early commitment to the gender of the referent, and that this commitment is strong en- ough to cause processing disruption upon reading a mismatching reflexive (Osterhout, Bersick, \{\&\} McLaughlin, 1997; Sturt, 2003).

        
Among the 210 filler items, 150 had similar structures and used similar determiners to the NPI con- ditions, but without the NPI ever.

        
with the gender stereotype of the main clause subject. In the two unacceptable conditions the reflexive violated the gender stereo- type of the main clause subject (e.g., The butcher burnt herself).

        
although the NPI materials and reflexive materials were structurally parallel, they were not lexically matched

        
8 conditions (5 NPI conditions, 3 reflexive conditions)

        
participants were significantly less accurate on the intrusive conditions than on the grammatical and the no licensor conditions

        
grand averages of 1200ms intervals surrounding the critical NPI or reflexive, consisting of a 200 ms pre-stimulus interval and a 1000 ms post-stimulus interval.

        
a 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline correction

        
A 10 Hz low-pass filter was applied to the grand average ERPs for presentation purposes, however all analyses were performed on unfiltered data.

        
six regions of interest (ROIs) were ini- tially defined, consisting of three electrodes at each ROI: left ante- rior (FT7, F3, FC3), midline anterior (FZ, FCZ, CZ), right anterior (F4, FC4, FT8), left posterior (TP7, CP3, P3), midline posterior (CPZ, PZ, OZ), and right posterior (CP4, P4, TP8)

        
No statistical analyses revealed significant main effects or interactions involving the laterality factor, and so this factor was removed from further analysis.

        
significant main effect of condition at the 200--400 ms interval and the 600--800 ms interval, and a marginally significant effect of condition at the 800--1000 ms interval

        
the ungrammatical no licensor condition elicited a P600 relative to each of the two grammatical control conditions

        
ungrammatical intrusive licensor conditions did not elicit a signif- icant P600 effect relative to the grammatical conditions

        
a broadly dis- tributed negativity in the intrusive licensor conditions

        
In order to evaluate the possible impact of the early negativity on the critical P600 effect we conducted a further set of ANOVA analyses based on a 200 ms post-stimulus baseline interval.

        
the negativity was present already in the 0--200 ms interval, earlier even than reports of the ELAN com- ponent elicited by word category violations (Friederici et al., 1993; Hahne \{\&\} Friederici, 1999; Neville et al., 1991)

        
Since the two different baselines did not impact the overall pattern of P600 effects, we conclude that the intrusion effect seen in the P600 is a genuine reflection of processing the NPI ever.

        
presentation of a negative polarity item in the ab- sence of a preceding licensor elicited a P600-like component, rela- tive to grammatical control conditions in which the NPI was licensed by a c-commanding NP containing no or very few

        
this P600 effect was either absent or substantially attenuated in ungrammatical sen- tences where the NPI was preceded by a non-c-commanding po- tential licensor

        
there was no delay between the onset of the gram- maticality effect and the onset of the effect of intrusive licensing

        
Our analyses found no evidence to suggest that intrusive licensing effects differ as a func- tion of licensor type.

        
This pattern of results is consistent with the interpretation that NPI intrusion effects reflect an immediate illusion of grammaticality, rather than the result of a later process initiated after detection of an anomaly.

        
Analysis of the ERPs for the reflexive conditions revealed a pos- terior positivity with an onset at around 400 ms in both the intru- sive and the incongruent conditions. This resembles the P600 component found in previous studies of reflexive violations

        
no differences between the incongruent and intrusive antecedent conditions

        
if this trend reflects a real dif- ference, it might be interpreted as a late intrusion effect

        
The ab- sence of a suitable antecedent/licensor led to a P600 effect in both cases, but the effect of the intrusive licensor/antecedent was not the same for reflexives and NPIs.

        
the intrusive licen- sor in some way disrupts the earliest stages of grammaticality detection for NPIs

        
intrusive antecedents do not impact the initial stages of reflexive binding in the same way that intru- sive licensors do for NPIs

        
The immediate constituents of each clause could be marked with a clause index that encodes which clause the constit- uent is a part of, expanding on the binary distinction between embedded and non-embedded clauses used in existing versions of the model.

        
The contrast between reflexives and NPIs presents a challenge for any theory that assumes (i) that NPI intrusion effect is the consequence of general-purpose retrieval mechanisms, and (ii) that reflexive binding and NPI licensing reflect similar item-to-item structural dependencies.

        
reflexive binding entails retrieval of an antecedent, whereas the semantic/pragmatic account of NPIs predicts that NPI licensing does not entail retrieval of a licensor.

        
Current leading accounts of negative polarity claim that the licensing condition results from an interaction between the lexical semantic features of NPIs and the semantic and pragmatic proper- ties of the linguistic environments that host the NPIs.

        
The role of negative implicatures provides a way to account for contrasts between pairs of sentences like I am surprised that we have any sugar. vs. ?I am sure we have any sugar (modified from Linebarger, 1987).

        
the lexical meanings of NPIs correspond to extreme values along a scale of contextually deter- mined alternatives

        
NPIs have the pragmatic effect of strengthening the statements that they occur in, and hence a successful licensing environment must have the property that the NPIs inclusion leads to a strengthened statement.

        
Restrictive relative clauses that contain negative quantifiers may be particularly prone to errone- ous implicatures.

        
comprehenders are sensitive to the contrastive function of restrictive modifiers, and can use the presence of a restrictive modifier to rapidly infer an intended contrast, e.g., the expression the tall cup implies a contrast with a non-tall cup (Altmann \{\&\} Steedman, 1988; Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, \{\&\} Carlson, 1999; Tanenhaus, Spivey- Knowlton, Eberhard, \{\&\} Sedivy, 1995)

        
Fischler and colleagues found no N400 difference to the final word in A robin is a bird and A robin is not a bird, but did observe a larger N400 in sentences with the- matically unrelated target words, such as A robin is not a vehicle (Fischler, Bloom, Childers, Roucos, \{\&\} Perry, 1983; see also Kounios \{\&\} Holcomb, 1992; Noveck \{\&\} Posada, 2003).

        
Although the factors that determine whether a negative inference is generated are not well under- stood, we suggest that speakers may be more likely to generate such inferences if the contrasting referents are made very salient in the discourse. Negative quantifiers can do exactly this.

        
NPI licensing may have more in common with the types of structural relations that are characteristically associated with the P600.

        
it has been suggested that this P600 reflects monitoring processes triggered when a comprehen- der detects uncertainty over syntax-semantics compatibility

        
the P600 elicited by unlicensed NPIs may correspond to two tempo- rally distinct components, which they associate with diagnosis and reanalysis, respectively (Drenhaus et al., 2006; see also Fried- erici, Mecklinger, Spencer, Steinhauer, \{\&\} Donchin, 2001)

        
Vasishth and colleagues attri- bute intrusive licensing to partial cue matching during retrieval of a licensor for the NPI, thereby treating the effect as representa- tive of a far broader phenomenon.

        
the presence of spurious pragmatic inferences may create immediate illusions of acceptability for NPIs, thus making error detection and reanalysis less likely.

        
our account does not involve specific retrieval of a licensor, and it depends on pragmatic infer- ences that are generated in specific contexts

        
Our ac- count is therefore consistent with the contrasting results in the NPI licensing and reflexive binding conditions in the current exper- iment, but many further tests will be required in order to deter- mine the generality of intrusive licensing effects.

        
ERP recordings demonstrated a robust electrophysiological correlate of intrusion effects for NPI licensing, in the form of a reduction in the P600 elicited by ungrammatical NPIs. But no corresponding modulation of the P600 was observed for reflexive binding, where syntactic con- straints appeared to prevent intrusive antecedents from influenc- ing the initial stages of anaphor resolution.

        
the kinds of semantic processes indexed by the N400 are probably different from the semantic processes involved in NPI licensing},

Therefore, there is a compelling need to develop an efficient and user-friendly information management system to handle the biomedical research data. This study evaluated the implementation of an information management system, which was introduced as part of the collaborative research to increase scientific productivity in a research laboratory. Laboratory members seemed to exhibit frustration during the implementation process. However, empirical findings revealed that they gained new knowledge and completed specified tasks while working together with the new system. Hence, researchers are urged to persist and persevere when dealing with any new technology, including an information management system in a research laboratory environment.},

@article{Schlesewsky:2006tp,
abstract = {Reanalysis in language comprehension provides a window on how superficially similar processes of conflict resolution may differ depending on the context in which they are initiated. Thus, previous ERP studies have shown that reanalyses towards object-initial orders in German sentences with dative-active verbs (e.g., folgen, 'to follow') engender N400 effects, while reanalyses with accusative verbs (e.g., besuchen, 'to visit') elicit P600 effects. This difference appears surprising since these two verb classes are both associated with a subject-initial base order. The present paper reports two ERP experiments designed to shed further light on the nature of the conflict resolution processes involved in each case by examining structures in which word order disambiguation is separated from verb class disambiguation. Experiment 1 contrasted dative-active verbs with accusative verbs, while Experiment 2 compared dative-active and dative object-experiencer verbs (which are associated with an object-initial base order). Our results show that the reanalysis pattern for dative-active constructions is context-dependent: when verb class disambiguation precedes word order disambiguation, an N400-P600 pattern results. By contrast, the reanalysis patterns for the other two verb types are context independent: object-experiencer verbs invariably show an N400 and accusative verbs invariably show a P600. We argue that (a) the N400 is a general marker of reanalysis in dative sentences, reflecting an argument reindexation, while (b) the P600 in accusative sentences reflects a structural recomputation. The variable pattern for dative-active sentences reflects the (in)applicability of "good-enough" representations during conflict resolution in garden path sentences.},

abstract = {The Association of Research Libraries E-Science Working Group developed a survey to “build an understanding of how libraries can contribute to e-science activities in their institution” and “identify organizations and institutions that have similar interests in e-science to leverage research library interests.” The August 2009 survey gathered 57 responses to the survey from the 123 ARL member libraries in the United States and Canada. Twenty-one respondents report their institution provides infrastructure or support services for e- science, 23 institutions are in the planning stages, and 13 do not provide support for e-science. After analyzing the survey results, the authors identi- fied a small set of respondents (Purdue University, the University of California, San Diego, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for interviews to further elaborate their activities. The resulting six case studies synthesize the interviews with the corresponding institutions’ responses to the survey. The cases further illuminate pro- grams and services mentioned only briefly in the survey and allow some interesting patterns to emerge from interviewees’ reflections on faculty connections, staffing levels, and organi- zational structure and culture.},

Event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded while subjects read German subject-object ambiguous relative and complement clauses. As both clause types are initially analyzed as subject-first structures, object-first structures require a revision which is more difficult for complement than for relative clauses. The hypothesis is tested that the revision process consists of two sub-processes, namely diagnosis and actual reanalysis. Applying a spatio-temporal principal component analysis to the ERP data, distinct positive sub-components presumably reflecting different sub-processes could be identified in the time range of the P300 and P600. It will be argued that the P600 is not a monolithic component, and that different sub-processes may be involved at varying time points depending on the type of garden-path sentence.},

It is argued that existing evidence is compatible only with probabilistic serial-reanalysis models, or ranked parallel models augmented with a reanalysis component. A new class of linguistic structures is introduced on which the behavior of serial and parallel parsers diverge the most radically: multiple local ambiguities are stacked to increase the number of viable alternatives in the ambiguous region from two to eight structures. This paradigm may provide the strongest test yet for parallel models.},

The intention is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {We show that comprehenders' expectations about upcoming discourse coherence relations influence the resolution of local structural ambiguity. We employ cases in which two clauses share both a syntactic relationship and a discourse relationship, and hence in which syntactic and discourse processing might be expected to interact. An off-line sentence-completion study and an on-line self-paced reading study examined readers' expectations for high/low relative-clause attachments following implicit-causality and non-implicit causality verbs (John detests/babysits the children of the musician who\ldots). In the off-line study, the widely reported low-attachment preference for English is observed in the non-implicit causality condition, but this preference gives way to more high attachments in the implicit-causality condition in cases in which (i) the verb's causally implicated referent occupies the high-attachment position and (ii) the relative clause provides an explanation for the event described by the matrix clause (e.g., \ldots who are arrogant and rude). In the on-line study, a similar preference for high attachment emerges in the implicit-causality context-crucially, before the occurrence of any linguistic evidence that the RC does in fact provide an explanation-whereas the low-attachment preference is consistent elsewhere. These findings constitute the first demonstration that expectations about ensuing discourse coherence relationships can elicit full reversals in syntactic attachment preferences, and that these discourse-level expectations can affect on-line disambiguation as rapidly as lexical and morphosyntactic cues.},

@article{Wicherts2011,
abstract = {Background
The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.


Methods and Findings
We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.


Conclusions
Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

abstract = {A number of recent electrophysiological studies of sentence processing have shown that a subclass of syntactic violations elicits very rapid ERP responses, occurring within around 200 ms of the onset of the violation. Such findings raise the question of how it is possible to diagnose violations so quickly. This paper suggests that very rapid diagnosis of errors is possible specifically in situations where the diagnosis problem is tightly constrained by specific expectations generated before the critical word is presented. In an event-related potentials (ERP) study of visual sentence reading participants encountered violations of a word order constraint (...Max's of...) that has elicited early ERP responses in previous studies. Across conditions the illicit sequence was held constant, while sentence context was used to manipulate the expectation for a noun following the possessor Max's, by manipulating the possibility of ellipsis of the head noun. Results showed that the anterior negativity elicited by the word category violation was attenuated when the availability of ellipsis reduced the expectation for a noun in the position of the offending preposition of, with divergence between conditions starting around 200 ms after the onset of the violation. This suggests a role for structural expectations in accounting for very fast syntactic diagnosis processes.},

DCMs are used to make inferences about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These inferences, however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the model. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition.},

abstract = {Working memory represents the ability of the brain to hold externally
or internally driven information for relatively short periods of
time. Persistent neuronal activity is the elementary process underlying
working memory but its cellular basis remains unknown. The most widely
accepted hypothesis is that persistent activity is based on synaptic
reverberations in recurrent circuits. The entorhinal cortex in the
parahippocampal region is crucially involved in the acquisition,
consolidation and retrieval of long-term memory traces for which
working memory operations are essential. Here we show that individual
neurons from layer V of the entorhinal cortex-which link the hippocampus
to extensive cortical regions-respond to consecutive stimuli with
graded changes in firing frequency that remain stable after each
stimulus presentation. In addition, the sustained levels of firing
frequency can be either increased or decreased in an input-specific
manner. This firing behaviour displays robustness to distractors;
it is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation, and relies
on activity-dependent changes of a Ca2+-sensitive cationic current.
Such an intrinsic neuronal ability to generate graded persistent
activity constitutes an elementary mechanism for working memory.},

abstract = {The increasingly complex research questions addressed by neuroimaging research impose substantial demands on computational infrastructures. These infrastructures need to support management of massive amounts of data in a way that affords rapid and precise data analysis, to allow collaborative research, and to achieve these aims securely and with minimum management overhead. Here we present an approach that overcomes many current limitations in data analysis and data sharing. This approach is based on open source database management systems that support complex data queries as an integral part of data analysis, flexible data sharing, and parallel and distributed data processing using cluster computing and Grid computing resources. We assess the strengths of these approaches as compared to current frameworks based on storage of binary or text files. We then describe in detail the implementation of such a system and provide a concrete description of how it was used to enable a complex analysis of fMRI time series data.},

@article{SlovinEtAl2002,
abstract = {A novel method of chronic optical imaging based on new voltage-sensitive
dyes (VSDs) was developed to facilitate the explorations of the spatial
and temporal patterns underlying higher cognitive functions in the
neocortex of behaving monkeys. Using this system, we were able to
explore cortical dynamics, with high spatial and temporal resolution,
over period of <or=1 yr from the same patch of cortex. The visual
cortices of trained macaques were stained one to three times a week,
and immediately after each staining session, the monkey started to
perform the behavioral task, while the primary and secondary visual
areas (V1 and V2) were imaged with a fast optical imaging system.
Long-term repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area
did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as confirmed repeatedly
by optical imaging based on intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns
of functional maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to
those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging based on
intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative amplitudes of the evoked
signals and differential map obtained using these two different imaging
methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes subthreshold activity
more than imaging based on intrinsic signals, that emphasized more
spiking activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1 ranged
from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The amplitude of the V2
response was only 20-60\% of that in V1. As expected from the anatomy,
the retinotopic responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally
across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of 0.15-0.19
m/s over a larger area than that expected by the classical magnification
factor, reaching its maximal anisotropic spatial extent within approximately
40 ms. We correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation
patterns with the monkey's saccadic eye movements and found that
due to the slow offset of the cortical response relative to its onset,
there was a short period of simultaneous activation of two distinct
patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual stimulus. We
also found that a saccade to a small stimulus was followed by direct
transient activation of a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2,
located retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory.},

RCR education has developed during three distinct eras: the 1980s, when policy makers were most concerned with defining and investigating research misconduct; the 1990s, when there was significant but highly decentralized growth in RCR instruction; and the years since 2000, when there have been a series of reforms and educational developments. There is still a need for scientists, universities, and professional societies to develop consensus on best ethical practices in many areas of scientific research. More also needs to be learned about assessing the quality of RCR instruction and the effects of training on researchers' behavior. To help set the course for RCR instruction in the future, more effort and funding need to be directed to studying actual research behavior and the factors that influence it; RCR educators and administrators must develop a common vocabulary and framework for developing and evaluating the impact of RCR instruction; and research institutions and funding agencies alike need to take a more active role in promoting and supporting RCR instruction.},

- good evidence for active-filler strategy

- kaan et al. (2002): p600 on verb that completes wh-dependency compared to control
- king \& kutas (1995): sustained anterior negativity (load of holding incomplete syntactic dependency in memory)
- Fiebach et al. (2002): SLAN in interval between object-initial wh-phrase and canonical position relative to same interval in subject-initial condition; no P600
- In German, wh-dependency may be completed before verb
- Effects of dependency length on both SAN and P600
- SAN persists throughout two-clause dependency, its growth is confied to first clause plus complementizer "that" of second clause; might not reflect working memory load
- No differences in amplitude of P600 as a function of distance, but long-distance later onset
- P600 wh vs. control: sensitive to number of syntactic integration operations
- N400 to second verb in long-distance wh: expectation for upcoming transitive verb is not fullfilled

Given RT samples, one can decide which of these three operation is the true decomposition rule by choosing the operation producing the smallest Smirnov distance between the RT samples combined in a certain way, as described by E. N. Dzhafarov and J. M. Cortese (1996, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 40, 185-202). By means of Monte- Carlo simulations, we determine at what sample sizes this decision identifies the true decomposition rule reliably. The results indicate that for a broad class of RT distribution functions the sample sizes required are by an order of magnitude larger when the component times are stochastically independent than when they are perfectly positively stochastically interdependent. In both cases, however, the required sample sizes are realistically achievable in an experiment, provided the experimental factors selectively influencing component times are sufficiently effective. Addition and maximum are generally more difficult to discriminate than addition and minimum, which in turn are more difficult to discriminate than maximum and minimum.},

We discuss relevant empirical findings and describe a computational model that captures how disfluencies influence parsing and comprehension. The research reviewed shows that the parser, which presumably evolved to handle conversations, deals with disfluencies in a way that is efficient and linguistically principled. The success of this research program reinforces the current trend in cognitive science to view cognitive mechanisms as adaptations to real-world constraints and challenges.},

All three types of miniature eye movements generate small random

Here we investigate the modulation of microsaccades by shifts of
covert attention in a classical spatial cueing paradigm. First, we
replicate the suppression of microsaccades with a minimum rate about
150 ms after cue onset. Second, as a new finding we observe microsaccadic
enhancement with a maximum rate about 350 ms after presentation of
the cue. Third, we find a modulation of the orientation towards the
cue direction. These multiple influences of visual attention on microsaccades
accentuate their role for visual information processing. Furthermore,
our results suggest that microsaccades can be used to map the orientation

An international network of demographic surveillance systems (DSS) now operates, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Thirty-eight DSS sites are coordinated by the International Network for the Continuous Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH). In this debate, Daniel Chandramohan and colleagues argue that DSS data in the INDEPTH database should be made available to all researchers worldwide, not just to those within the INDEPTH Network. Basia Zaba and colleagues argue that the major obstacles to DSS sites sharing data are technical, managerial, and financial rather than proprietorial concerns about analysis and publication.

This question was investigated by globally increasing and/or decreasing luminance or contrast in photographs of real-world scenes across saccadic eye movements or during matched brief interruptions in a flicker paradigm. The results from two experiments demonstrated very poor sensitivity to global image changes in both the saccade-contingent and flicker paradigms, suggesting that the specific values of basic sensory properties do not contribute to the perception of stability across saccades during complex scene perception. In addition, overall sensitivity was significantly worse in the saccade-contingent change paradigm than the flicker paradigm, suggesting that the flicker paradigm is an imperfect simulation of transsaccadic vision.},

Reading the verbs of an object relative sentence, such as The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error, takes more time for readers with less working memory capacity for language, and their resulting comprehension is less accurate. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of a concurrent working memory load and found that with no load or a small memory load many Low Span readers comprehended object relative sentences very poorly although their reading times in the critical area of these sentences were greater than those of High Span subjects. Experiment 2 replicated the reading time effects of Experiment 1 for object relative sentences and showed that pragmatic information improved the comprehension of the lower capacity readers, although their use of this information was limited to the clause in which it was presented.},

abstract = {This study is the first to investigate: (a) 'temporal performance fields,' whether the speed of information accrual differs for different locations at a fixed eccentricity, and (b) whether covert attention modulates temporal dynamics differentially at isoeccentric locations. Using the speed accuracy tradeoff (SAT) procedure, we derived conjoint measures of how isoeccentric locations and precueing targets location affect speed and accuracy in a search task. The results demonstrate the existence of temporal performance fields, analogous to spatial performance fields: information accrual was fastest for target on the horizontal meridian, intermediate for targets at the intercardinal locations, slow for targets on the vertical meridian, and slowest for targets at the North (N) location (accrual time pattern: E\&W<intercardinal<S<N). Surprisingly, in contrast to spatial performance fields, where covert attention enhanced discriminability at all locations to a similar degree, attention differentially sped up processing at the slower locations, with a greater benefit evident along the vertical than the horizontal meridian, particularly at the N location, and an intermediate benefit at intercardinal locations (viz., N>S>intercardinal>E\&W). Hence, the compensatory effect of attention eliminated the temporal asymmetries across isoeccentric locations.},

The completion of a working draft of the human genome sequence two years ago will, no doubt, prove to be an integral chapter in a story of extraordinary technological achievement- a story based on the continued revelation of genetic information. ... The public debate aside, the federal courts, principally the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have both attempted to provide guidance on the intellectual property rights that might impact such matters involving the human genome and other genetic data. These efforts, however, have met with lackluster support at best from patent law practitioners and other commentators, as well as the general public. ... Moreover, attempts to obtain patent protection for early stage research products may negatively impact scientific progress. ... Given the rapidity with which technology will be available to affect whole genomic sequencing over the next decade, new models must also emerge to engage these capabilities within the health care regime, and to guard against exploitation by those "with access" to the detriment of the individual. ...},

abstract = {{In this chapter, we focus on a previously ignored aspect of sentence processing theories: is processing difficulty caused by reanalysis or competition? According to two-stage theories (e.g., Frazier, 1979; Rayner, Frazier, \{\&\} Carlson, 1983), reanalysis should occur when an initially adopted reading is inappropriate. In contrast, current constraint-based theories (e.g., Mac\}Donald, 1994; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, \{\&\} Tanenhaus, 1998) claim that processing difficulty is due to a competition between two or more syntactic analyses that are about equally activated. We review a number of eye-tracking experiments investigating this issue. No competition was observed in any of the experiments, thus ruling out current constraint-based theories. In fact, the opposite pattern emerged: sentences that should have produced processing difficulty according to constraint-based theories were actually easier to process than sentences that should not have produced difficulty. The data also turn out to be problematic for two-stage theories, as non-syntactic information appears to be employed before the point of reanalysis. The data provide evidence for a new model of syntactic ambiguity resolution (cf. Traxler, Pickering, \{\&\} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, \{\&\} Traxler, 1999), the unrestricted race model. In this model, processing difficulty is due to reanalysis, but multiple sources of information can determine which analysis is initially adopted.},

abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with
a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should
be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude
is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that,
in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic
fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the
one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal
amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite
number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found
that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion
used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It
is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter
and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum
quautization schemes for2\^{}\{b\}quanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7, are given numerically
for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.

In addition, half of the sentences were printed in a font that was easy to read (Times New Roman) and the other half were printed in a font that was more difficult to read (Old English). Word frequency, word predictability, and font difficulty effects were apparent in the eye movement data of both groups of readers. In the fixation time data, the pattern of results was the same, but the older readers had larger frequency and predictability effects than the younger readers. The older readers skipped words more often than the younger readers (as indicated by their skipping rate on selected target words), but they made more regressions back to the target words and more regressions overall. The E-Z Reader model was used as a platform to evaluate the results, and simulations using the model suggest that lexical processing is slowed in older readers and that, possibly as a result of this, they adopt a more risky reading strategy.},

The studies under discussion, examined the failure to license a negative polarity item (NPI) in German: Saddy et al. (2004a) reported an N400 component when the NPI was not accurately licensed by negation; Drenhaus et al., 2004 and Drenhaus et al., to appear considered additionally the influence of constituency of the licensor in NPI constructions. A biphasic N400-P600 response was found for the two induced violations (the lack of licensor and the inaccessibility of negation in a relative clause). The symbolic resonance analysis (SRA) revealed an effect in the P600 time window for the data in Saddy et al., which was not found by using the averaging technique. The SRA of the ERPs in Drenhaus et al., showed that the P600 components are distinguishable concerning the amplitude and latency. It was smaller and earlier in the condition where the licensor is inaccessible, compared to the condition without negation in the string. Our findings suggest that the failure in licensing NPIs is not exclusively related to semantic integration costs (N400). The elicited P600 components reflect differences in syntactic processing. Our results confirm and replicate the effects of the traditional voltage average analysis and show that the SRA is a useful tool to reveal and pull apart ERP differences which are not evident using the traditional voltage average analysis.},

abstract = {Between-Task Double Dissociation is defined as a particular pattern of effects of two factors (manipulations) F and G on performance measures M-sub(T1 and M-sub(T2 in two tasks implemented by different complex processes. F and G might be the amounts of damage in two brain regions. The factors must influence the measures selectively: M-sub(T1 influenced by F but invariant with respect to G; M-sub(T2 influenced by G but invariant with respect to F. Let "dd(M-sub(T1), M-sub(T2); F, G)" denote this set of two influence properties and two invariance properties. Investigation of such cases may be called task comparison; what are dissociated are the complex processes used to carry out the two tasks. I consider in this paper a type of within-task double dissociation that can serve as evidence for the modularity of subprocesses of a single complex process, and is the basis of a method for process decomposition, an idea developed in detail in Sternberg (2001) with a dozen diverse applications. The inferential logic, summarized briefly in this article, depends on whether our measures of the subprocesses are "pure" or "composite". The comments that follow the summaries are intended to clarify some aspects of the logic; several also apply to between - task double dissociation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA},

We present a cognitive model of conceptual representations and processing*the Conceptual Structure Account (CSA; Tyler \& Moss, 2001)*as an example of a distributed, feature-based approach. In the first section, we describe the CSA and evaluate relevant neuropsychological and experimental behavioural data. We discuss studies using linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli, which are both presumed to access the same conceptual system. We then take the CSA as a framework for hypothesising how conceptual knowledge is represented and processed in the brain. This neurocognitive approach attempts to integrate the distributed feature-based characteristics of the CSA with a distributed and feature-based model of sensory object processing. Based on a review of relevant functional imaging and neuropsychological data, we argue that distributed accounts of feature-based representations have considerable explanatory power, and that a cognitive model of conceptual representations is needed to understand their neural bases.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: International calls for registering all trials involving humans and for sharing the results, and sometimes also the raw data and the trial protocols, have increased in recent years. Such calls have come, for example, from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Health Organization (WHO), the US National Institutes of Heath, the US Congress, the European Commission, the European ombudsman, journal editors, The Cochrane Collaboration, and several funders, for example the UK Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Hewlett Foundation. Calls for data sharing have mostly been restricted to publicly-funded research, but I argue that the distinction between publicly-funded and industry-funded research is an artificial and irrelevant one, as the interests of the patients must override commercial interests. I also argue why it is a moral imperative to render all results from all trials involving humans, also healthy volunteers, publicly available. Respect for trial participants who often run a personal and unknown risk by participating in trials requires that they - and therefore also the society at large that they represent - be seen as the ultimate owners of trial data. Data sharing would lead to tremendous benefits for patients, progress in science, and rational use of healthcare resources based on evidence we can trust. The harmful consequences are minor compared to the benefits. It has been amply documented that the current situation, with selective reporting of favorable research and biased data analyses being the norm rather than the exception, is harmful to patients and has led to the death of tens of thousands of patients that could have been avoided. National and supranational legislation is needed to make data sharing happen as guidelines and other voluntary agreements do not work. I propose the contents of such legislation and of appropriate sanctions to hold accountable those who refuse to share their data.},

Originating as presentations at the 2002 International Studies Association meetings in New Orleans, the following set of papers examines issues concerning the potential replication of research results from a number of different conceptual and technical perspectives. It also spans an array of journals and journal editors in our field that confront issues of replication on a regular basis. The interactions generated by this symposium have already led to the agreement, detailed at the end of the symposium among the four leading internations relations journals to adopt a single common replication policy. The editors of these journals challenge others to follow their lead. The Editors of ISP hope that this symposium begins a larger discussion on these issues and invites commentary from interested scholars. Lastly, I want to thank Nils Petter Gleditsch for soliciting, organizing, and coordinating the contributions to this symposium. Without his work, this project would not have come to fruition as quickly or in as insightful a fashion. Three anonymous reviewers also provided detailed comments on the entire set of articles in this symposium. We are indebted to the care and effort they gave to the project. Mark A. Boyer},

annote = {Main Claims: (1) case attaction can hapen even if the antecedent is morphologically not compatible with the attracted case (2) only marked case can be attracted, and only by unmarked antecedents ==> structures computed by HSPM contain information (i) about synt. markedness - but (ii) not about morphological ambiguity of NPs According to Eberhard(1997) marked features [in his case, 'plural'] are specified by flags/features in the NP representation, whereas unmarked features have *no* representation, i.e. are default. According to him this does not lead to any problems with two unmarked features (Nom and Acc) because the difference between these is represented structurally. There are two possibilities for why Case Attraction occurs, CAH or PFH. CAH (Case Attraction Hypothesis): (Marked) Case features *errnously* percolate to the wrong NP, i.e. antecedent of the relative pronoun. PFH (Parallel Function Hypothesis): Parallelism (in case) is an ambiguity resolution strategy applied by the parser. [I don't understand how this would help parsing, so I find it hard to call it an "ambiguity resolution strategy". Also the errnous vs. non-errnous distinction is pretty subjective. The crucial difference, however, is the the requirement of ambiguity.] Experiment 1: CAH vs. PFH Stimuli: Wir alle konnten gut verstehen, ... SO: (a)	control	dass unsere Chefin ... (unambiguous) (b)	ambiguous	dass Judith, der man uebrigens das Auto geklaut hat, ... with RC (c)	unambiguous	dass unsere Chefin, der man uebrigens das Auto geklaut hat, ... with RC ... ein so gutes Angebot annahm OS: (d)	control	dass unserer Chefin ... (unambiguous) (e)	ambiguous	dass Judith, die uebrigens wieder umgezogen ist, ... with RC (f)	unambiguous	dass unserer Chefin, die uebrigens wieder umgezogen ist, ... with RC ... ein so gutes Angebot schmeichelte Predictions: CAH: Difficulty in (b,c) compared to (a) and (e) compared to (d). Case Attraction in conditions (b,c), because RelPro is marked, the antecedent is not. Additional garden path in (e), because of the local ambiguity of 'Judith' together with the generic SO preference in German (Judith will be analyzed as subject at first). PFH: Same as CAH, but no difficulty in (c), because it is not compatible with dative. Results: SO OS (a) (b) (c)	(d) (e) (f) 92 77 74 85 85 85 - Accuracy 605 686 697 626 759 647 - Reaction Time Discussion: Bader sees PFH disconfirned, due to a difficuly in (c). [The SO preference predicted for (e) might be in RT instead of Accuracy, although it's a bit surprising.] [ However: The effects can be explained by complexity. In OS, even (Acc-initial) controls have a lower accuracy. Now, Dat-initial clauses might lead to even worse performance than Acc-initial ones. Thus, ]},

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite a pressing and well-documented need for better sharing of information on clinical trials data quality assurance methods, many research organizations remain reluctant to publish descriptions of and results from their internal auditing and quality assessment methods. PURPOSE: We present findings from a review of a decade of internal data quality audits performed at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, a large academic research organization that conducts data management for a diverse array of clinical studies, both academic and industry-sponsored. In so doing, we hope to stimulate discussions that could benefit the wider clinical research enterprise by providing insight into methods of optimizing data collection and cleaning, ultimately helping patients and furthering essential research. METHODS: We present our audit methodologies, including sampling methods, audit logistics, sample sizes, counting rules used for error rate calculations, and characteristics of audited trials. We also present database error rates as computed according to two analytical methods, which we address in detail, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of two auditing methods used during this 10-year period. RESULTS: Our review of the DCRI audit program indicates that higher data quality may be achieved from a series of small audits throughout the trial rather than through a single large database audit at database lock. We found that error rates trended upward from year to year in the period characterized by traditional audits performed at database lock (1997-2000), but consistently trended downward after periodic statistical process control type audits were instituted (2001-2006). These increases in data quality were also associated with cost savings in auditing, estimated at 1000 h per year, or the efforts of one-half of a full time equivalent (FTE). LIMITATIONS: Our findings are drawn from retrospective analyses and are not the result of controlled experiments, and may therefore be subject to unanticipated confounding. In addition, the scope and type of audits we examine here are specific to our institution, and our results may not be broadly generalizable. CONCLUSIONS: Use of statistical process control methodologies may afford advantages over more traditional auditing methods, and further research will be necessary to confirm the reliability and usability of such techniques. We believe that open and candid discussion of data quality assurance issues among academic and clinical research organizations will ultimately benefit the entire research community in the coming era of increased data sharing and re-use.},

In this endeavour, a cognitive model is crucial as without it, the cognitive neuroscientist does not know what to look for in the brain, what the nature of the relevant representations might be, or how the different components of a process might interact with each other. In the cognitive neuroscience of language, the interaction of theoreticalmodels and brain research has, however, been far fromideal, especially when it comes to the study of meaning at the sentence level. Although theoretical semantics has a long history in linguistics and thus offers detailed and comprehensive models of the nature of semantic representations, these theories have had minimal impact on the brain investigation of semantic processing. In this article, we outlinewhat a theoretically grounded cognitive neuroscience of semantics might look like and summarise our own findings regarding the neural bases of semantic composition, the basic combinatory operation that builds the complex meanings of natural language.},

abstract = {A theory of the way working memory capacity constrains comprehension is proposed. The theory proposes that both processing and storage are mediated by activation and that the total amount of activation available in working memory varies among individuals. Individual differences in working memory capacity for language can account for qualitative and quantitative differences among college-age adults in several aspects of language comprehension. One aspect is syntactic modularity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits interaction among syntactic and pragmatic information, so that their syntactic processes are not informationally encapsulated. Another aspect is syntactic ambiguity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits them to maintain multiple interpretations. The theory is instantiated as a production system model in which the amount of activation available to the model affects how it adapts to the transient computational and storage demands that occur in comprehension.},

abstract = {Sternberg's additive factor method was generalized to apply to tasks involving both serial and concurrent processing. The generalization is based on the critical path method of scheduling. The effects on reaction time of factors prolonging separate processes in a task are discussed: in general these effects are interactions of a simple form. Reaction times can be used to deduce, in part, the schedule of the mental processes in a task, including their order of execution. Bounds on process durations can be derived. Often there are redundant equations so the method can be easily rejected if it does not apply. A dual task experiment by Greenwald was analyzed. In the task subjects were presented with two stimuli and made aresponse to each under high and low compatibility conditions. Two bottlenecks in processing were located: (a) Subjects make only one decision at a time, in accordance with single channel theory, although the high compatibility condition may be an exception; (b) there is a mental process which takes longer when the stimuli conflict. The decisions about the two stimuli probably change places in the schedula when compatibility is changed.},

abstract = {Eye movements were recorded as subjects read sentences containing temporary structural ambiguities. In accord with the garden-path theory of sentence com-prehension, shorter reading times were found for sentences conforming to certainindependently motivated parsing strategies (late closure and minimal attach- ment) than for comparable sentences which violate these strategies. Further,longer fixation durations were associated with the very first fixation in the region of the sentence which disambiguated the sentence, suggesting that the humansentence-parsing mechanism operates in a rather systematic fashion, immediatelycomputing the structural consequences of fixated material for the analysis ofpreceding material. The pattern of regressive eye movements did not conform tothe view that the parsing mechanism automatically returns to the beginning of thesentence to revise an incorrect analysis of linguistic material nor did it supportthe view that the parsing mechanism systematically backtracks through the sen-tence until the source of the erroneous analysis is located. Rather, the pattern ofregressions indicated that the parsing mechanism typically engages in selectivereanalysis, exploiting whatever information it has available about the type of errorit has committed to guide its reanalysis attempts. Finally, it is emphasized that anunderstanding of the parser's revision procedures is essential to an explanation ofwhy certain linguistic structures cannot be successfully parsed by humans.},

abstract = {General processing tree (GPT) models are usually used to analyze categorical data collected in psychological experiments. Such models assume functional relations between probabilities of the observed behavior categories and the unobservable choice probabilities involved in a cognitive task. This paper extends GPT models for categorical data to the analysis of continuous data in a class of response time (RT) experiments in cognitive psychology. Suppose that a cognitive task involves several discrete processing stages and both accuracy (categorical) and latency (continuous) measures are obtained for each of the response categories. Furthermore, suppose that the task can be modeled by a GPT model that assumes serialization among the stages. The observed latencies of the response categories are functions of the choice probabilities and processing times (PT) at each of the processing stages. The functional relations are determined by the processing structure of the task. A general framework is presented and it is applied to a set of data obtained from a source monitoring experiment.

abstract = {The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in experimental psychology. One popular strategy for controlling SAT is to use the response signal paradigm. This paradigm produces time-accuracy curves (or SAT functions), which can be compared across different experimental conditions. The typical approach to analyzing time-accuracy curves involves the comparison of goodness-of-fit measures (e.g., adjusted-R2), as well as interpretation of point estimates. In this article, we examine the implications of this approach and discuss a number of alternative methods that have been successfully applied in the cognitive modeling literature. These methods include model selection criteria (the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion) and interval estimation procedures (bootstrap and Bayesian). We demonstrate the utility of these methods with a hypothetical data set.},

abstract = {Background: Genomics research data are often widely shared through a variety of mechanisms including publication, meetings and online databases. Re-identification of research participants from sequence data has been shown possible, raising concerns of participants' privacy. Methods: In 2008-09, we convened 10 focus groups in Durham, N.C. to explore attitudes about how genomic research data were shared amongst the research community, communication of these practices to participants and how different policies might influence participants' likelihood to consent to a genetic/genomic study. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcripts were complemented by a short anonymous survey. Of 100 participants, 73\% were female and 76\% African-American, with a median age of 40-49 years. Results: Overall, we found that discussants expressed concerns about privacy and confidentially of data shared through online databases. Although discussants recognized the benefits of data-sharing, they believed it was important to inform research participants of a study's data-sharing plans during the informed consent process. Discussants were significantly more likely to participate in a study that planned to deposit data in a restricted access online database compared to an open access database (p < 0.00001). Conclusions: The combination of the potential loss of privacy with concerns about data access and identity of the research sponsor warrants disclosure about a study's data-sharing plans during the informed consent process.},

abstract = {German pronouns (er(MALE/masculine), sie(FEMALE/feminine)) that refer to a person are determined by the biological gender (MALE/FEMALE) and/or syntactic gender (masculine/feminine) of the person. Pronouns (er(masculine), sie(feminine)) that refer to a thing are determined by the syntactic gender of this thing (Garten [garden]masculine, Tasche [hand-bag]feminine). The study aimed to investigate whether semantic integration, syntactic integration, or both are involved in establishing co-reference between pronoun and subject/antecedent in sentences. Here we focused on two event-related potential components: the SPS/P600, related to syntactic violation and reanalysis, and the N400 component, related to semantic integration problems. In one condition, a person was introduced as antecedent and later referred to by a pronoun, which either agreed in biological/syntactic gender or not (biological/syntactic gender violation). In a second condition, a thing was introduced as antecedent and the corresponding pronoun either agreed in syntactic gender or not (syntactic gender violation). Results at critical pronouns showed a P600 effect for incongruent compared with congruent pronouns in both conditions with a centro-parietal maximum. This effect was larger for the person compared to the thing condition. We interpreted this finding as reflecting a syntactic integration process that can be influenced by conceptual/semantic and syntactic information of the antecedent type. Furthermore, at the word following the pronoun, we observed an N400 for the thing but not for the person condition. We suggest, supported by the results of a control experiment, that this effect reflects continuous integration processes for things, whereas for persons the integration seems to be finished at pronoun position.},

abstract = {A FIRST-EVER SURVEY of cultural anthropologists was conducted concerning the sharing of data, interpretations, and results with study participants. Briefly summarized, the study showed that almost all of the survey respondents had shared data or results with participants and almost all found this to be a positive experience. They had carried out research in many countries, some over long periods of time, and many had completed several field projects. Most believe that researchers, either alone or in consultation with participants and their groups, should decide whether, when, and what to share. Anthropologists find that sharing produces many benefits, for themselves as individuals and as researchers, for individual participants, and for the communities, groups, or institutions to which the latter belong. The perceived harms that might result from sharing have to do particularly with potential threats to privacy, confidentiality or anonymity, as well as the possibilities of social conflict and oppression. Thus, researchers have serious concerns about the sharing of certain kinds of data that might lead to such consequences. While many or most respondents think that sharing is the ethically proper course of action, they are very aware of the complexities of particular situations and the need for nuanced decision making. Most think that the researcher should play a major role in deciding whether sharing should take place and what should be shared. Hence, for these cultural anthropologists, in the end, sharing requires trying to balance the good of sharing with the good of doing no harm to those with whom they have done research.},

abstract = {The computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction of neuronal morphology is becoming an increasingly popular technique to quantify the arborization patterns of dendrites and axons. The resulting digital files are suitable for comprehensive morphometric analyses as well as for building anatomically realistic compartmental models of membrane biophysics and neuronal electrophysiology. The digital tracings acquired in a lab for a specific purpose can be often re-used by a different research group to address a completely unrelated scientific question, if the original investigators are willing to share the data. Since reconstructing neuronal morphology is a labor-intensive process, data sharing and re-analysis is particularly advantageous for the neuroscience and biomedical communities. Here we present numerous cases of "success stories" in which digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology were shared and re-used, leading to additional, independent discoveries and publications, and thus amplifying the impact of the "source" study for which the data set was first collected. In particular, we overview four main applications of this kind of data: comparative morphometric analyses, statistical estimation of potential synaptic connectivity, morphologically accurate electrophysiological simulations, and computational models of neuronal shape and development.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A. Identify the current state of data management needs of academic biomedical researchers. B. Explore their anticipated data management and analysis needs. C. Identify barriers to addressing those needs. DESIGN: A multimodal needs analysis was conducted using a combination of an online survey and in-depth one-on-one semi-structured interviews. Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific Northwest. MEASUREMENTS: The results from 286 survey respondents were used to provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: 1) there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for core data management; 2) there is broad perceived need for additional support in managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3) the barriers to acquiring currently available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and unmet expectations of institutional support. CONCLUSION: Themes identified in this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve their own problems. Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on three components: 1) facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of interoperability and analysis; 2) improve the ability of researchers to maintain provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the leveraging of standards; and 3) develop and support information management service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a spectrum of informatics capabilities.},

Yet, complex ethical, political, technical, and social issues surround the secondary use of health data. While not new, these issues play increasingly critical and complex roles given current public and private sector activities not only expanding health data volume, but also improving access to data. Lack of coherent policies and standard "good practices" for secondary use of health data impedes efforts to strengthen the U.S. health care system. The nation requires a framework for the secondary use of health data with a robust infrastructure of policies, standards, and best practices.

abstract = {BACKGROUNDPublic sharing of scientific data has assumed greater importance in the omics era. Transparency is necessary for confirmation and validation, and multiple examiners aid in extracting maximal value from large data sets. Accordingly, database submission and provision of the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)3 are required by most journals as a prerequisite for review or acceptance. METHODSIn this study, the level of data submission and MIAME compliance was reviewed for 127 articles that included microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) profiling and were published from July 2011 through April 2012 in the journals that published the largest number of such articles--PLOS ONE, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Blood, and Oncogene--along with articles from 9 other journals, including Clinical Chemistry, that published smaller numbers of array-based articles. RESULTSOverall, data submission was reported at publication for <40\% of all articles, and almost 75\% of articles were MIAME noncompliant. On average, articles that included full data submission scored significantly higher on a quality metric than articles with limited or no data submission, and studies with adequate description of methods disproportionately included larger numbers of experimental repeats. Finally, for several articles that were not MIAME compliant, data reanalysis revealed less than complete support for the published conclusions, in 1 case leading to retraction. CONCLUSIONSThese findings buttress the hypothesis that reluctance to share data is associated with low study quality and suggest that most miRNA array investigations are underpowered and/or potentially compromised by a lack of appropriate reporting and data submission.},

containing a complex NP followed by a relative clause (e.g., ...
"the daughter of the colonel who had an accident"). As has been previously
reported, Spanish sentences were read more rapidly when the content
of the relative clause forced it to modify the first of the two NPs
in the complex NP ("the daughter") than when it modified the second
NP ("the colonel"). Their English translations showed no difference
in reading time. This preference to take the first noun as a host
for the relative clause in Spanish occurred whether the relative
clause was disambiguated by morphological gender marking or by its
content. The results are generally consistent with the claim that
the Late Closure parsing strategy does not apply universally across
languages. However, we propose an alternative hypothesis, namely,
that the Late Closure parsing strategy fails to apply across all
phrase types within a language, and applies to relative clauses in
neither English nor Spanish. Instead, a different principle, which
we term the "construal hypothesis", accounts for processing of phrases
such as relative clauses which do not play the role of a "primary

          The processing role of structural constraints on the interpretation of pronouns and anaphors
        
        
         - Badecker, W; Straub, K )

        
        
Previous studies held that structural conditions on coreference work as interpretive filters that impose exceptionless limits on which ante- cedent candidates can be evaluated by subsequent, content-based processes. These experiments instead support an interactive-parallel-constraint model, in which multiple weighted constraints (including constraints on binding) simultaneously influence the net activation of a candidate during preselection stages of antecedent evaluation.

        
Studies such as Caramazza et al.'s (1977) and Erlich's (1980) show that processing is facilitated if the local context contains only one referent that conforms to the pronoun's person, number, and gender.

        
A pronoun that refers to the most prominent member of the current focus of attention is generally easier to interpret than repeated names or explicit descriptions that could otherwise refer success- fully to the same entity (Gordon \{\&\} Chan, 1995; Gordon et al., 1993, 1999).

        
To formulate these syntactic constraints, linguists distinguish two major classes of referentially dependent expressions: pronominals (I or me, you, he or him, she or her, etc.) and anaphors (reflexives [myself, yourself, himself, herself, etc.] and reciprocals [each other]).

        
A phrase c-commands a phrase if and only if every syntactic constituent that contains the phrase also contains the phrase . If is coreferential with and is c-commanded by , then the phrase is said to be bound by the phrase .

        
That is, do the earliest stages of the interpretive process evaluate NPs that are ultimately excluded by purely structural criteria? Or is structural accessibility an immediate and primary filter for candidate status?

        
Recent experimental work by Gordon and Hendrick (1997) confirmed that native English speakers' coreference judgments pattern along the predictions of the binding theory for contexts like those in Examples 1 and 2. However, that same study also reported cases in which speakers are reluctant to attribute coreference relations that are clearly licensed by the binding theory.

        
Nicol and Swinney reasoned that the mechanism for anaphor resolution reactivates the antecedent and that activation then spreads to the antecedent's semantic associates.

        
If a particular NP fails the binding theory's syntactic relation test, then from the outset it is excluded from the set of referent candidates assessed by other evaluative mechanisms. In subsequent discus- sion, we refer to this as the initial-filter model.

        
This shift in felicity suggests that binding principles may not be independently sufficient to capture the factors that influence the process of coreference resolution

        
An alternative interpretation is that the observed facilitation derives from the effects of selection rather than from candidate evaluation.

        
Because other cues that might have influenced the process are carefully controlled in Nicol and Swinney's stim- uli, it is reasonable to assume that participants ultimately selected each antecedent about half of the time. Therefore, the reported facilitation could represent priming for the associates of the se- lected antecedent boxer (and no priming for associates of skier) on half of the trials and priming for the associates of the selected antecedent skier (and no priming for associates of boxer) on the other half of the trials.

        
Although this alternative hypothesis effectively describes the reported priming pattern, it requires that pronoun resolution is fast enough to allow full ante- cedent selection---and its consequent activation of semantic asso- ciates---within the observed response window.

        
We refer to the processing-load difference between sentences like Examples 8a and 8c as the multiple- candidate effect. Whereas the interactive-constraint model holds that this effect will be observed whenever more than one salient candidate NP is available in the local discourse, the initial-filter model predicts that the presence of additional matching NPs will increase processing load only when the additional candidates are grammatically accessible to the pronoun or reflexive.

        
A second, more credible alternative to the initial-filter model is that the observed priming pattern reflects the net activation for each antecedent candidate summed across parallel acting constraints during the preselection stage of antecedent evalua- tion.

        
In contrast to Nicol and Swinney's (1989) assumption that initial processing of coreference relations entails exclusive, inhibitory filtering, work by MacDonald and MacWhinney (1990) and Gernsbacher (1989) converged on the claim that antecedent selection includes both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms.

        
Taken together, the data suggest that the initial-filter model may overstate the role of accessibility constraints in the early stages of candidate identi- fication.

        
Whereas the initial- filter model asserts that referential processing is a cascaded pro- cess in which structure based principles act as a preemptive filter on the input to subsequent semantic and pragmatic processing mechanisms, we propose that all feature-matching referents that are members of the local focus of attention are evaluated by content-based mechanisms in the antecedent selection process--- independent of their structural relation to the to-be-interpreted pronoun or reflexive.

        
Crucially, if a candidate NP receives positive sup- port from one constraint (e.g., a content-based constraint such as morphosyntactic agreement) and inhibition from another (e.g., a structurally based constraint from the binding theory), then the excitatory activation for that candidate will be func- tionally canceled out. We refer to this as the interactive- parallel-constraint model.

        
We hypothesized that when only one NP matches the pronoun in gender, the effect of structural position for that matching NP should be evident in the form of longer reading times in the region following the pronoun in the inaccessible-match condition (Example 11) in comparison with the corresponding material in the accessible-match condition (Example 10).

        
The initial-filter model predicted equivalent reading times for the multiple-match and accessible-match conditions because both con- tain a single accessible antecedent. In contrast, the interactive- constraint model predicted faster reading times for the accessible- match condition, in which all constraints converge positively on a single antecedent candidate, than for the multiple-match condition.

        
Both the initial-filter model and the interactive-constraint model predict that the fastest reading times will be observed for the accessible-match condition and that an observable no-antecedent effect will be observed for the no-match cases. However, the models differ with respect to the relative processing load antici- pated for the multiple-match condition.

        
If binding principles preemptively eliminate all grammatically inaccessible nouns from the antecedent-candidate set, as the initial-filter model maintains, then Examples 9 and 10 should appear identical to subsequent coreference-processing mechanisms.

        
In all items in this and subsequent experiments (with the exception of Experiment 4), gender-unambiguous proper names were used for these manipulations rather than definite descriptions because names have been shown to be more effective in establishing discourse focus than descriptive referring expressions (Sanford, Moar, \{\&\} Garrod, 1988).

        
Experiment 1 consisted of a 2 2 design in which the factors accessible-NP fit (match vs. mismatch) and inaccessible-NP fit (match vs. mismatch) were crossed to provide the four treatment conditions.

        
The treatment conditions for each sentence set were created by alternating the gender of the proper names while holding the gender of the pronoun constant.

        
There were several critical text regions that were considered in this and the following experiments: (a) The region preceding the pronoun/ anaphor/referring expression; (b) the pronoun/anaphor/referring expression, itself; and (c) the first two (usually phrasal) pairs of contiguous words following the pronoun (region1 and region2, respectively).

        
As anticipated, no reading-time differences were observed for the region leading up to the pronoun (nor for the pronoun itself) on either the planned-text groupings or the single-word reading-time analyses.

        
Within region1, there emerged both a main effect of accessible-NP fit, F1(1, 19) 6.69, and an interaction between accessible-NP fit and inaccessible-NP fit, F1(1, 19) 7.18. There was no main effect for inaccessible-NP fit.

        
As shown in Figure 1, reading times for the material in region1 (the boxed area in the figure) was 111 ms longer in the no-match condition than in the accessible-match condition (acces- siblematch706ms,SE24;nomatch817ms,SE36; F1[1, 19] 12.61).

        
Greene et al. (1992) have argued that participants must use strategically controlled interpretive mechanisms to dif- ferentiate gender matching from nonmatching candidates and that these mechanisms are not applied in experimental settings unless required by the task (e.g., comprehension questions that depend on disambiguating pronominal reference). But if the use of gender were so easily suspended, then one should not observe a no- antecedent effect in the task used here

        
As seen in Figure 3, reading times in the critical region were 74 ms longer in the multiple-match items than in the accessible-match items (multiple match 780 ms, SE 33; accessible match 706 ms, SE 24; F1[1, 19] 8.17). Given that the initial-filter model asserts that inaccessible candidates will be invisible to the coreference processor, this finding is clearly problematic for that model.

        
The fact that there is clear evidence that participants did forge such links supports the automaticity of such processing (see also Arnold et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 1999).

        
postpronominal reading times were slowed in the multiple-match condition in comparison with the accessible-match condition

        
The second methodological concern is that the multiple- candidate effect might only reflect processing strategies that par- ticipants adopted to accommodate the fact that the experimental list included a number of sentences with pronouns that lacked an antecedent---a violation of the general expectation that pronouns will be meaningful.

        
That we did observe such an effect is evidence that the candidate is evaluated on the basis of its fit with the pronoun. In other words, the mechanisms that impose interpretive constraints on the basis of binding principles do not render the inaccessible candidate completely invisible to other components of the evalu- ation process.

        
In such an account, the added processing cost associated with the multiple-match condition merely indicates that it is easier to maintain a discourse representation when the participants in an event are easier to distinguish. This alternative account was easy to test, because it predicted that if we manipu- lated the number of gender-matching names, then we would ob- serve the same processing-load effect for sentences with and without pronouns.

        
Although the locus of the reading-time differences suggests that the processing-load increase reflects the cost of coreference resolution, it is nevertheless conceivable that the differences reflect a process- ing confound incurred prior to the pronoun.

        
Within the pronoun items, partici- pants were 52 ms slower reading region1 when the inaccessible name matched than when it did not match the pronoun gender (multiple match 787 ms, SE 20; single match 735 ms, SE 17; F1[1, 43] 14.73).

        
The effect of manipulating the gender of the embedded-clause subject in the pronoun condition of Experi- ment 2 replicates Experiment 1: Postpronoun reading times were longer in the multiple-match condition than in the single-match condition. However, there were no effects for the manipulation of the embedded-clause subject in the name condition in any sentence position.

        
Although we nearly eliminated the number of sentences containing pronouns with no available antecedent in this experi- ment, we still observed the multiple-match effect. Thus, we can conclude that this effect of a grammatically inaccessible gender- matched NP arises because mechanisms that evaluate candidate antecedents for pronouns consider the full set of prominent, gender-matched NPs and that this set is not initially filtered by the constraints imposed by binding theory.

        
If the grammar contains only Principle A (governing the distribution and interpretation of anaphors), and Principle B merely represents a generalization by which the com- plementary distribution of pronouns and reflexives is derived, then the results of Experiments 1 and 2 would not directly challenge models of anaphor resolution in which binding principles function as initial filters.

        
Experiment 3 examined whether participants' performance on sentences with reflexives differs from their performance on sentences with pronouns.

        
However, as indicated in Figure 5, the main effect for match condition was carried largely by differences within region1 (in particular, by the second word following the referentially dependent expression).

        
the match effect for a struc- turally inaccessible NP does not depend on the type of referentially dependent expression (pronoun vs. reflexive)

        
Like reflexives, reciprocals are grammatical anaphors, and there- fore their interpretation is governed by Principle A of the binding theory. On the basis of this constraint, each other can only be bound by the judges in these sentences. If the number specification of an NP functions like gender in formulating the initial set of candidate antecedents, then one might predict a reading-time effect for the manipulation of the inaccessible subject the attorneys following a reciprocal anaphor.

        
However when reading times are collapsed across the four posi- tions following the reciprocal, reading times for this region were 48 ms longer in the multiple-match than in the single-match condition (multiple match 1,565, SE 37; single match 1,517, SE 36; F1[1, 35] 4.37).

        
However, we did not expect to observe an effect for the inaccessible-NP manipula- tion in Experiment 5 unless it was also observed in Experiment 6.

        
The interpretation of a reciprocal is dependent on its being linked to a plural antecedent, and when there are multiple prominent plural expressions, the resolution of the linking relation is slowed.

        
Therefore, the genitive NP differs from the phrases manipulated in the first four experiments (a main or embedded-clause subject) in that it is less prominent and does not receive its thematic role from a verb.

        
In Experiments 1--4, the grammatically inaccessible NPs that slowed the interpretation of a pronoun, reflexive, or reciprocal, always functioned as the grammatical subject of the clause con- taining the semantically dependent expression.

        
It was tempting to suggest, on the basis of these findings, that local salience consti- tutes a factor that elevates discourse entities into the set of poten- tial antecedent candidates. However, such a conclusion would have been premature.

        
Even if one sees no effect for the genitive-NP manipulation in the reflexive conditions, the absence of a viable antecedent in pronoun sentences should increase read- ing times following the pronoun in comparison with when there is one suitable antecedent.

        
Experiment 5 addressed this by exploring the impact of grammatically nonsalient referential anchors, such as genitives, on the resolution of ante- cedent relations. If the initial candidate set for a reflexive included all gender-matching discourse entities, then we should have seen an effect for the choice of genitive.

        
Alternatively, we hypothesized, it could be that nonsubject referents will be projected onto the initial candidate set only if they play a central role in the local context (e.g., if they are semantic arguments of the verb). Experiment 6 explored this by examining whether nonsubject argument NPs affect the initial stages of core- ference processing. If semantic arguments of the main or embed- ded verb were automatically considered as initial candidates as long as they match on the appropriate morphosemantic-- morphosyntactic dimensions, then we should have seen reading- time differences between the single and multiple-match conditions for this experiment.

        
On the basis of the previous experiments, we predicted that if every name in the sentence projects onto the set of potential antecedent candidates, then we should observe an ambiguity effect for the reflexive items and a no-antecedent effect for the pronoun items.

        
The manipulation of gender for the grammatically inaccessible nonsubject NP did not have the same effect the manipulation of subject NPs had in Experiment 3. Here, there was no multiple- candidate effect in the reflexive conditions. This supports Gordon et al.'s (1999) finding that a prenominal possessive NP is not as prominent as the full NP that contains it. However, there was a no-antecedent effect in the pronoun conditions.

        
If thematic argument status is sufficient to procure membership in the initial candidate set, then one might expect longer reading times following the reflexive when the inaccessible argument name matches the reflexive in gender, as in Example 20a, in comparison with when it does not, as in Example 20b.

        
It is important to recall that the match and mismatch conditions had a very different status in the pronoun and reflexive sentences in this experiment. For reflexives, mismatch was a single anteced- ent condition, whereas for the pronoun sentences mismatch was a no-antecedent condition (with respect to the accessible NPs only).

        
No significant reading-time differences were observed for individual words or adjacent-word positions in the region leading up to or including the reflexive nor in any of the regions following the reflexive.

        
One might be tempted to hypothesize that the absence of an effect for the inaccessible NP in these two experiments suggests that for some reason the participants in these studies did not resolve the refer- ential relations in the sentence stimuli. This is highly unlikely.

        
Taken together with the results of the previous studies, these findings point to limita- tions on the initial set of referents that are considered as candidate antecedents for pronouns and reflexives.

        
The parser assigns a structural role to a phrase almost as quickly as the categorical status of the phrase is established (Rayner, Carlson, \{\&\} Frazier, 1983; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, \{\&\} Sedivy, l995). Immediate word-by-word analysis of structural relations is one feature of human sentence processing that makes rapid incremental interpretation possible.

        
In the domain of coreference processing, findings from cross-modal priming studies have been used to support the claim that the structural constraints on binding rela- tions function as an initial filter on antecedent evaluation and selection (Nicol \{\&\} Swinney, 1989).

        
In four experiments, varying the gender of a syntactically inaccessible phrase altered the processing load associated with interpreting a pronoun or anaphor. In each instance, the reading times for positions following the dependent expression were longer when a grammatically inaccessible subject phrase agreed in gender (and number) with the pronoun or anaphor.

        
If the reading-time results were obtained because the out- come of early acting binding principles was subsequently ignored by later, exceptional processes triggered by gender information, the hypothetical shift in timing would also alter the manner in which binding principles are hypothesized to influence coreference processing.

        
Our interpretation of the preceding experiments might be taken to suggest a model in which a somewhat unconstrained set of sentence-processing mechanisms is placed in conflict with an underlyingly rigid set of grammatical principles.

        
One might propose, for example, that morpho- logical factors may be brought into play at slower presentation rates in ways that they could not (or simply are not) with faster presentation rates. We agree with the general point that the speed of presentation may alter the relative availability of different types of information associated with the constituents of the sentence stimulus, and this might affect the way that processing components interact.

        
Thus, the initial candidate set can include grammatically inaccessible nominees because identifying candi- dates on the basis of content and evaluating candidates on the basis of structure are computational tasks carried out over different types of information and are therefore invoked by different, albeit par- allel, processing mechanisms.

        
In summary, we have processing-load evidence that reveals how structural constraints interact with other types of information about antecedent candidates in the process of interpreting referentially dependent expressions.

        
grammatical constraints exert their effect on the selection of candidates early in the course of interpretation by evaluating members of a set that is initially composed of all currently prom- inent discourse entities

probability is minimal. With increasing launch site distance, however,
the OVP was found to move towards the word beginning. Several possible
causes of refixations were discussed. The issue of refixation saccade
programming was extensively investigated, suggesting that pre-planned
and directly controlled refixation saccades coexist. Second, PVL
curves, that is landing position distributions, show that the eyes
are systematically deviated from the OVP, due to visuomotor constraints.
By far the largest influence on mean and standard deviation of the
Gaussian PVL curve was exhibited by launch site distance. Third,
it was investigated how fixation durations vary as a function of
landing position. The IOVP effect was replicated: Fixations located
at word center are longer than those falling near the edges of a
word. The effect of word frequency and/or launch site distance on
the IOVP function mainly consisted in a vertical displacement of
the curve. The Fixation-Duration IOVP effect is intriguing because
word center (the OVP) would appear to be the best place to fixate
and process a word. A critical part of the current work was devoted
to investigate the origin of the effect. It was suggested that the
IOVP effect arises as a consequence of mislocated fixations, i.e.
fixations on unintended words, which are caused by saccadic errors.
An algorithm for estimating the proportion of mislocated fixations
from empirical data was developed, based on extrapolations of landing
position distributions beyond word boundaries. As a new central theoretical
claim it was suggested that a new saccade program is started immediately
if the intended target word is missed. On average, this will lead
to decreased durations for mislocated fixations. Because mislocated
fixations were shown to be most prevalent at the beginning and end
of words, the proposed mechanism generated the inverted U-shape for
fixation durations when computed as a function of landing position.
The proposed mechanism for generating the effect is generally compatible
with both oculomotor and cognitive models of eye-movement control
in reading. },

It is shown how predictive accuracy depends on sample size and the number of predictor variables. Both two-sample and single-sample cross-validation indices are investigated. The application of cross-validation methods to the analysis of moment structures is then justified. An equivalence of a single-sample cross-validation index and the Akaike information criterion is pointed out. It is seen that the optimal number of parameters suggested by both single-sample and two-sample cross-validation indices will depend on sample size. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

Speeded decisions based on several types of information were examined in 3 experiments, involving, respectively, a line discrimination task, lexical decisions, and an Erikson flanker task. Three levels of SAT were obtained in each experiment by adjusting response deadlines with an adaptive tracking algorithm. Speed stress affected the duration of RT stages both before and after the start of the LRP in all experiments. The latter effect cannot be explained by guessing strategies, by variations in response force, or as an indirect consequence of the pre-LRP effect. Contrary to most models, it suggests that SAT can occur at a late postdecisional stage.},

Publishing the findings of research in peer reviewed journals implies a high level of confidence by the authors in the veracity of their interpretation. Therefore it stands to reason that researchers should be prepared to share their raw data with other researchers, so that others may enjoy the same level of confidence in the findings. Method: In a prospective study, 29 corresponding authors of original research articles in a medical journal (the British Medical Journal) were contacted to ascertain their preparedness to share the data from their research. The email contact was in one of two forms, a general request and a specific request. The type of request a researcher received was randomly allocated. Findings: Researchers receiving specific requests for data were less likely, and slower, to respond than researchers receiving general requests. Only one researcher released data. Most researchers were reluctant to release their data. Some required further information, clarification, or authorship. Interpretation: The general reluctance of researchers to consider requests for their data is of concern. It raises questions about the level of confidence that should be placed on their interpretations of the data. It also highlights an unfortunate situation where researchers are more concerned with losing an advantage than advancing science.},

- is prominence a matter of higher activation or a qualitatively different state of activation.

- if the former, all representations are stored in a passive way, so retrieval is necessary
- SAT: "Accounts which assume that prominent antecedents have a stronger, more distinctive representation in the comprehender’s discourse model predict higher asymptotic accuracy, but not differences in the dynamics of the time-course functions. This prediction follows directly from time-course studies examining the retrieval of sequentially presented items from working memory."

Simplicity is often represented by parameter counts; the fewer the parameters, the simpler the model. Arguments are presented here suggesting that simplicity has little place in discussions of modeling; instead, the concept of flexibility should be substituted. When comparing two models one should be wary of the possibility of their differential flexibility. Several methods for assessing relative flexibility are possible, as represented in this special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. Here, the method of cross-validation is applied in the comparison of two models, a linear integration model (LIM) and the fuzzy-logical model of perception (FLMP), in the fitting of 44 data sets concerning the perception of layout seen among three panels with the presence or absence of four sources of information for depth. Prior to cross-validation the two models performed about equally well; after cross-validation LIM was statistically superior to FLMP, but the overall pattern of fits remained nearly the same for both models.

In this study, the waking EEG was measured in the daytime todetermine
the presence of diurnal variations in the activity of standardfrequency
bands and to compare these variations with the temporal patternstypical
of sleep propensity and subjective alertness. Alertness was evaluated
infour men and 12 women, aged 19±33 y. Assessments were conducted
every 2 h, from10.00 to 24.00, in the following order: a visual analogue
scale of alertness, awaking EEG recording and a sleep latency test.
The waking EEG was recorded witheyes open. For each recording session,
32±60 s of artefact-free signals wereselected from the C3/A2 derivation,
then subjected to amplitude spectralanalysis. Four EEG frequency
bands showed significant diurnal variations: delta,theta, sigma and
beta1. None of these variations showed a significant correlationwith
the temporal patterns of sleep latencies or subjective alertness.
At theindividual level, however, theta band activity increased when
subjectivealertness decreased, suggesting that the theta band can
be used to monitorvariations in alertness in a given individual,
even at the moderate levels ofsleepiness experienced during the daytime.},

@article{Anderson:2006p1645,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Providing for long-term and consistent public access to scientific data is a growing concern in biomedical research. One aspect of this problem can be demonstrated by evaluating the persistence of supplementary data associated with published biomedical papers. METHODS: We manually evaluated 655 supplementary data links extracted from PubMed abstracts published 1998-2005 (Method 1) as well as a further focused subset of 162 full-text manuscripts published within three representative high-impact biomedical journals between September and December 2004 (Method 2). RESULTS: For Method 1 we found that since 2001, only 71 - 92\% of supplementary data were still accessible via the links provided, with 93\% of these inaccessible links occurring where supplementary data was not stored with the publishing journal. Of the manuscripts evaluated in Method 2, we found that only 83\% of these links were available approximately a year after publication, with 55\% of these inaccessible links were at locations outside the journal of publication. CONCLUSION: We conclude that if supplemental data is required to support the publication, journals policies must take-on the responsibility to accept and store such data or require that it be maintained with a credible independent institution or under the terms of a strategic data storage plan specified by the authors. We further recommend that publishers provide automated systems to ensure that supplementary links remain persistent, and that granting bodies such as the NIH develop policies and funding mechanisms to maintain long-term persistent access to these data.},

abstract = {It is proposed that the human sentence parsing device assigns phrase structure to word strings in two steps. The first stage parser assigns lexical and phrasal nodes to substrings of roughly six words. The second stage parser then adds higher nodes to link these phrasal packages together into a complete phrase marker. This model of the parser is compared with ATN models, and with the two-stage models of Kimball (1973) and Fodor, Bever and Garrett (1974). Our assumption that the units which are shunted from the first stage to the second stage are defined by their length, rather than by their syntactic type, explains the effects of constituent length on perceptual complexity in center embedded sentences and in sentences of the kind that fall under Kimball's principle of Right Association. The particular division of labor between the two parsing units allows us to explain, without appeal to any ad hoc parsing strategies, why the parser makes certain ‘shortsighted’ errors even though, in general, it is able to make intelligent use of all the information that is available to it.},

abstract = {Cognitive control processes associated with long- and short-term adjustments of human behaviour have attracted much interest recently. It is still unclear, however, whether the mechanisms underlying these adjustments share a common locus within the chain of stimulus-response processing. In order to address this issue, the present study employed a speed-accuracy instruction producing a macro-trade-off, whereas micro-trade-off was studied by means of posterror slowing in reaction time (RT). Participants performed a spatially compatible or incompatible four-stimuli-to-two-response alternative choice RT task. Reliable variations in micro-and macro-trade-off as well as effects of spatial compatibility were found in RT and error rate. Most importantly, posterror slowing was larger when instruction stressed accuracy rather than speed, an effect being independent of spatial compatibility. Because the influence of speed-accuracy instruction and posterror slowing on performance was strongest for response alternations, together present findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying micro- and macro-trade-offs have one common locus at the level of motor processing. Additional influences of macro-trade-off on premotoric processing are likely.},

These paradoxes have important implications for the interpretation of evidence from observational studies. This article uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how the three paradoxes are different manifestations of one phenomenon--the reversal paradox--depending on whether the outcome and explanatory variables are categorical, continuous or a combination of both; this renders the issues and remedies for any one to be similar for all three. Although the three statistical paradoxes occur in different types of variables, they share the same characteristic: the association between two variables can be reversed, diminished, or enhanced when another variable is statistically controlled for. Understanding the concepts and theory behind these paradoxes provides insights into some controversial or contradictory research findings. These paradoxes show that prior knowledge and underlying causal theory play an important role in the statistical modelling of epidemiological data, where incorrect use of statistical models might produce consistent, replicable, yet erroneous results.},

GE representations contrast with ones that are detailed, complete,

the original argument for GE processing, and we present new evidence
that supports the concept: first, local interpretations are computed,
which can interfere with global ones; second, new findings based
on the recording of event-related potentials show the use of simple
heuristics rather than compositional algorithms for constructing
sentence meaning; and recent studies show that the comprehension
system has mechanisms for handling disfluencies, but they work imperfectly.
We argue that the GE approach to language comprehension is similar
to the use of fast and frugal heuristics for decision-making, and
that future research should explore this connection more thoroughly.},

Nevertheless, there has been a shift away from discrete models and toward continuous ones. The research reported in this article demonstrates discrete processing of information in an anagram task selected because of its similarity to insight problems, which seem subjectively to produce discrete "illumination" during processing. The authors used speed-accuracy decomposition (SAD), a relatively new technique for investigating the time course of information processing. The results of 2 experiments indicate little or no partial information in the anagram tasks, in contrast to previous research with SAD, all of which has revealed partial information. General models of human information processing must therefore be able to account for both patterns.},

@article{LewisShvartsmanSingh:2013,
abstract = {We explore the idea that eye-movement strategies in reading are precisely adapted to the joint constraints of task structure, task payoff, and processing architecture. We present a model of saccadic control that separates a parametric control policy space from a parametric machine architecture, the latter based on a small set of assumptions derived from research on eye movements in reading (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, \& Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Warren, \& McConnell, 2009). The eye-control model is embedded in a decision architecture (a machine and policy space) that is capable of performing a simple linguistic task integrating information across saccades. Model predictions are derived by jointly optimizing the control of eye movements and task decisions under payoffs that quantitatively express different desired speed-accuracy trade-offs. The model yields distinct eye-movement predictions for the same task under different payoffs, including single-fixation durations, frequency effects, accuracy effects, and list position effects, and their modulation by task payoff. The predictions are compared to-and found to accord with-eye-movement data obtained from human participants performing the same task under the same payoffs, but they are found not to accord as well when the assumptions concerning payoff optimization and processing architecture are varied. These results extend work on rational analysis of oculomotor control and adaptation of reading strategy (Bicknell \& Levy, ; McConkie, Rayner, \& Wilson, 1973; Norris, 2009; Wotschack, 2009) by providing evidence for adaptation at low levels of saccadic control that is shaped by quantitatively varying task demands and the dynamics of processing architecture.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and inaccessibility of Internet references in the bibliography of biomedical publications when first released in PubMed. METHODS: During a one-month observational study period (Feb 21 to Mar 21, 2006) the Internet citations from a 20\% random sample of all forthcoming publications released in PubMed during the previous day were identified. Attempts to access the referenced Internet citations were completed within one day and inaccessible Internet citations were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 4,699 publications from 844 different journals. Among the 141,845 references there were 840 (0.6\%) Internet citations. One or more Internet references were cited in 403 (8.6\%) articles. From the 840 Internet references, 11.9\% were already inaccessible within two days after an article's release to the public. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Internet citations in journals included in PubMed is small (<1\%); however, the inaccessibility rate at the time of publication is considered substantial. Authors, editors, and publishers need to take responsibility for providing accurate and accessible Internet references.},

(4) the standardization sample of the total population represented,
(5) the problem of predicting the rate of change of IQ and the need
for automatic adjustment of norms or restandardization, and (6) the
prediction of norms from a relatively small sample. A discussion
of the serious questions that can be raised about the quality of
the test precedes a section containing conclusions, implications,
and recommendations. extensive appendixes include a Spanish translation

of the word recognition process is assumed to be a categorical representation
with no residual uncertainty. Yet perception is inevitably uncertain,
and a system making optimal use of available information might retain
this uncertainty and interactively recruit grammatical analysis and
subsequent perceptual input to help resolve it. To test for the possibility
of such an interaction, we tracked readers' eye movements as they
read sentences constructed to vary in (i) whether an early word had
near neighbors of a different grammatical category, and (ii) how
strongly another word further downstream cohered grammatically with
these potential near neighbors. Eye movements indicated that readers
maintain uncertain beliefs about previously read word identities,
revise these beliefs on the basis of relative grammatical consistency
with subsequent input, and use these changing beliefs to guide saccadic
behavior in ways consistent with principles of rational probabilistic
inference.},

abstract = {Two questionnaire studies and two experiments investigated the processing of the pronouns her and him/his. The questionnaires and the first experiment searched for effects of lexical preferences in resolving the temporary syntactic category ambiguity of the word her. Contingent frequency based on a verb's preference for a human vs an inanimate direct object demonstrably affected the final interpretation of an ambiguous her following the verb in an off-line questionnaire study. However, it did not influence on-line processing times for SPEC versus NP uses of her. This result is surprising from the perspective of current lexically based models of ambiguity resolution. Experiment 2 addressed how potential antecedents for the unambiguous pronouns him and his are identified. Both Experiment I and Experiment 2 showed that NP uses of personal pronouns like her and him could be processed more easily than SPEC uses of her and his. Experiment 2 showed that this difference largely reflected differences in difficulty of choosing an antecedent for the pronoun. To account for the processing of her, we proposed that the parser initially builds an underspecified syntactic representation, fixing further details and disambiguating the category of her as subsequent information becomes available. Comprehension proceeds by attempting to find an antecedent for the personal pronoun, with the preferred candidate a syntactically available within-sentence antecedent if one exists. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},
annote = {- resolution of personal pronouns as np "he saw her" vs. spec "he saw her cat"
- two questionnaires: some verbs are biased towards either possibility
- experiment 1: verb bias does not affect difficulty of resolution, but spec is more difficult than np; perhaps looking for legal antecedent within clause because possible but none is found in spec case
- experiment 2: manipulation number of subject np to vary if legal antecedent present or not; further manipulation his/him (overt marking spec or np); effect of subject number only for spec (contra badecker \& straub 1994)
- conclusion: no early influence of verb properties on pronoun resolution, but overall advantage for np pronouns that disappears when the sentence subject agrees with the spec pronoun "his"
- the parser immediately attempts to find a syntactically legal antecedent in the same sentence},

abstract = {One influential hypothesis posits that the brain regions implicated
in Broca's aphasia are responsible for specific syntactic operations
that are necessary for the comprehension and production of sentences
(Grodzinsky, 1986, 1990, in press). The empirical basis of this hypothesis
is the claim that Broca's aphasics have no difficulty understanding
sentences in the active voice (and other "canonical" sentence types,
such as subject relatives and clefts with negative predicates), but
perform at chance level with passive voice constructions (and other
"noncanonical" sentences such as object-gap relatives and object
clefts). In the face of well-established results indicating that
Broca's aphasics can exhibit several different performance patterns
on these sentence types, Grodzinsky, Pi\{$\backslash$$\backslash$\~{}n\}ango, Zurif, and Drai
(1999) argued that these conflicting results do not challenge the
theory when the data are analyzed appropriately. They carried out
a creative statistical analysis of the comprehension performance
of published cases of Broca's aphasia and concluded that all of these
cases are in agreement with the predicted pattern: chance on passives
and 100\% correct on actives. Here we show that the statistical reasoning
adopted by Grodzinsky et al. (1999) is flawed. We also show that
the comprehension performance of a substantial number of the Broca's
aphasics in their own sample does not conform to the pattern required.
Rather, contrary to these authors' claim, Broca's aphasia is not
associated with a consistent pattern of sentence comprehension performance,
but allows for a number of distinct patterns in different patients.},

abstract = {The book presents recent developments in the field of correlated data
analysis. Its aim is to give a systematic account of regression models
and their application to the modelling and analysis of correlated
data. Longitudinal data have been used for the development and illustration
of the methodologies. In addition to marginal models and mixed-effects
models, the book covers topics on joint regression analysis, on Gaussian
copulas and generalised state space models for longitudinal data
from long time series. Various real-world data examples, numerical
illustrations and software usage tips are presented throughout the
book, making it suitable for graduate courses on correlated data
analysis. The book places also emphasis on some recent developments
on correlated data analysis as well as on the technical details of
the theory and methodology underlying the related software applications.
Thus, it may also serve as a reference for those that need theoretical
explanations and a deeper understanding of the theory that underlies
the related analyses. The book is structured in 13 chapters. Chapter
1 provides an introduction to the subject matter, including some
examples of the data types treated by correlated analysis. Chapter
2 is devoted to a review of the theory of dispersion models, while
Chapter 3 gives a systematic treatment for the theory of inference
functions. Chapter 4 provides a general discussion on strategies
for modelling correlated data, and introduces several methods to
simulate correlated data that are essential in simulation studies.
Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to the marginal and vector generalised
linear models, respectively, while Chapters 7 ad 8 are devoted to
the mixed-effects models, another class of models for the analysis
of correlated data, focusing on likelihood-based and Bayesian methods
for inference, respectively. Chapter 9 is devoted to the best linear
unbiased predictor, while Chapters 10, 11, and 12 discuss generalised
state space models and their application to longitudinal binomial
and count data. Finally, Chapter 13 is devoted to another topic that
is highly relevant to the analysis of correlated data and concerns
the missing data problem arising particularly from longitudinal data.},

We argue that better understanding of comprehension processes does not necessarily follow from observed correlations between text variables and eye-fixation parameters. Further, recent rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) research suggests that eye fixation data obtained from studies of normal reading might have little practical value in optimizing the readability of RSVP displays and other means of text presentation.},

abstract = {The data underlying scientific papers should be accessible to researchers both now and in the future, but how best can we ensure that these data are available? Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, structure. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost 1000-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all. We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with ∼8 d delay and some disagreement with authors. Given the long-term benefits of data accessibility to the academic community, we believe that journal-based mandatory data archiving policies and mandatory data availability statements should be more widely adopted.},

First published February12, 2003; 10.1152/jn.01075.2002. We studied
the variability in saccades by comparing the peak velocities of saccades
with the sametarget amplitude made with different actual amplitudes.
We testedthree hypotheses: the pulse-height noise hypothesis (peak
velocity andamplitude vary proportionally), the localization noise
hypothesis(variability in amplitude and peak velocity lie along the
main sequence), and the independent noise hypothesis (variability
in amplitude and peak velocity are independent). We measured eye
orientationin two experiments by a scleral coil and a video system.
Surprisingly,the main source of variability of saccades depended
on the measurement system used. A combination of localization noise
and indepen-dent noise best describes the data obtained by the video
system. Theindependent noise (e.g., measurement inaccuracy) was the
mainsource of variability. For the scleral coils, the variability
was considerably larger than for the less accurate video system.
The pulse-heightnoise hypothesis best describes this additional variability.
Thereforewe conclude that pulse-height noise is the main source of
variabilityin saccades measured with scleral coils. We discuss the
influence ofscleral coils on saccade generation and suggest that
a change in motorstrategy due to the discomfort of wearing the coils
might be the causeof the increased variability.},

At issue was whether eye movement measures are affected by the additional requirement of detection. Global comparisons showed robust effects of task type with longer fixations and fewer word skippings when letter detection was required. Detailed analyses of target words, however, further showed that reading with and without letter detection yielded virtually identical effects of word class and text predictability for word-skipping rate and similar effects for different word viewing duration measures. The overall oculomotor pattern suggested that detection does not substantially shift normal reading movements in response to lexical cues and thereby indicated that detection tasks are informative about word and specifically word class processing in normal reading.},

For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a plug-and-play approach with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.},

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

abstract = {The functional dissociation of human extrastriate cortical processing
streams for the perception of face identity and location was investigated
in healthy men by measuring visual task-related changes in regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography (PET)
and H2(15)O. Separate scans were obtained while subjects performed
face matching, location matching, or sensorimotor control tasks.
The matching tasks used identical stimuli for some scans and stimuli
of equivalent visual complexity for others. Face matching was associated
with selective rCBF increases in the fusiform gyrus in occipital
and occipitotemporal cortex bilaterally and in a right prefrontal
area in the inferior frontal gyrus. Location matching was associated
with selective rCBF increases in dorsal occipital, superior parietal,
and intraparietal sulcus cortex bilaterally and in dorsal right premotor
cortex. Decreases in rCBF, relative to the sensorimotor control task,
were observed for both matching tasks in auditory, auditory association,
somatosensory, and midcingulate cortex. These results suggest that,
within a sensory modality, selective attention is associated with
increased activity in those cortical areas that process the attended
information but is not associated with decreased activity in areas
that process unattended visual information. Selective attention to
one sensory modality, on the other hand, is associated with decreased
activity in cortical areas dedicated to processing input from other
sensory modalities. Direct comparison of our results with those from
other PET-rCBF studies of extrastriate cortex demonstrates agreement
in the localization of cortical areas mediating face and location
perception and dissociations between these areas and those mediating
the perception of color and motion.},

abstract = {The scanpath theory of visual perception was tested using Web pages
as visual stimuli. Scanpaths are repetitive sequences of fixations
and saccades that occur upon reexposure to a visual stimulus. Since
Internet users are exposed to repeated visual displays, the Web provides
ideal stimuli to test this theory. Eye movement data were recorded
for subjects' repeated viewings of three Web pages over three sessions.
Resemblance of eye path sequences was measured with a string-edit
method; multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to
group sequences. Support was found for the scanpath theory; some
clusters included pairs of sequences from the same subject. A repeated
measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant
main effect for stimulus type, with a text-intensive news story page
generating more similar sequences than a graphic-intensive advertising
page. There was a statistically significant main effect for cross-viewing
comparisons, reflecting a linear trend in which eye paths for the
same subject became more alike over time.},

abstract = {When saccades are evoked by suddenly pre- sented visual stimuli, the stochastic distribution of their reaction times is typically recinormal, in conformity with the LATER model of decision-making, some- times with an additional sub-population of early responses. In the real world, saccades are more often spontaneous responses to static features of the visual world; nevertheless, the time between the end of one saccade and the start of the next may be regarded as a reaction time to the new image that is presented to the retina. The distribution of these times is qualitatively similar to that of evoked saccades, but typically with a longer median and more of the early responses. Here, we analyse the statistical distributions of Wxation times from a large database of spontaneous saccades made while reading and show that the distributions are altered in characteristic ways by particular features of the current Wxation: likely familiarity of the currently Wxated word, and its proximity to the preceding Wxa- tion. These alterations are of the kind predicted by LATER: familiarity appears to inXuence the mean rate at which the decision signal approaches completion, whereas proximity to the previous Wxation, presumably because it provides partial prior information about the upcoming word, appears to increase prior probability. We conclude that spontaneous saccades may be suc- cessfully described by the same decision-making model that can be used for evoked ones},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural History science is characterised by a single immense goal (to document, describe and synthesise all facets pertaining to the diversity of life) that can only be addressed through a seemingly infinite series of smaller studies. The discipline's failure to meaningfully connect these small studies with natural history's goal has made it hard to demonstrate the value of natural history to a wider scientific community. Digital technologies provide the means to bridge this gap. RESULTS: We describe the system architecture and template design of "Scratchpads", a data-publishing framework for groups of people to create their own social networks supporting natural history science. Scratchpads cater to the particular needs of individual research communities through a common database and system architecture. This is flexible and scalable enough to support multiple networks, each with its own choice of features, visual design, and constituent data. Our data model supports web services on standardised data elements that might be used by related initiatives such as GBIF and the Encyclopedia of Life. A Scratchpad allows users to organise data around user-defined or imported ontologies, including biological classifications. Automated semantic annotation and indexing is applied to all content, allowing users to navigate intuitively and curate diverse biological data, including content drawn from third party resources. A system of archiving citable pages allows stable referencing with unique identifiers and provides credit to contributors through normal citation processes. CONCLUSION: Our framework http://scratchpads.eu/ currently serves more than 1,100 registered users across 100 sites, spanning academic, amateur and citizen-science audiences. These users have generated more than 130,000 nodes of content in the first two years of use. The template of our architecture may serve as a model to other research communities developing data publishing frameworks outside biodiversity research.},

abstract = {The value of responsible conduct of research (RCR) education from an administrative perspective can be summed up in the oft-used adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The National Academy of Sciences has underscored the importance of RCR education in three major reports relating public trust in research to the perception and reality of integrity within the field. Compliance and integrity cannot simply be hoped for. Rising numbers of reported cases of research misconduct support this view. This scenario calls for institutions to provide an environment where research integrity is a fundamental prerequisite. Supporting this notion is the adoption by federal oversight agencies of the compliance elements delineated in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations as a guide for determining whether an institution promotes a culture of integrity. RCR education is most valuable to the administrator in raising the awareness of researchers regarding compliance and integrity issues and thereby reducing the risk of infraction. In turn, the overall level of confidence among users and supporters may be improved also. Therefore, RCR education has become a primary operational arm of administration in the quest for institutional stability.},

Full consideration of these arguments supports the hypothesis that attention is allocated serially during reading.},

Thirty-seven participants silently read sentences containing compound words as target words while their eye movements were being recorded. We manipulated word length and frequency to examine how task instructions influence orthographic versus lexical-semantic processing during reading. Task instructions influenced both temporal and spatial aspects of eye movements: The initial landing position in words was shifted leftward, the saccade length was shorter, first fixation and gaze duration were longer, and refixation probability was higher during proofreading than during reading for comprehension. Moreover, in comparison to instructions for reading for comprehension, proofreading instructions increased both orthographic and lexical-semantic processing. This became apparent in a greater word length and word frequency effect in gaze duration during proofreading than during reading for comprehension. The present study suggests that the allocation of attentional resources during reading is significantly modulated by task demands.},

abstract = {We propose a mixed-effects vector auto-regressive (ME-VAR) model for studying brain effective connectivity. One common approach to investigating inter-regional associations in brain activity is the multivariate auto-regressive (VAR) model. The standard VAR model unrealistically assumes the connectivity structure to be identical across all participants in a study and therefore, could yield misleading results. The ME-VAR model overcomes this limitation by incorporating a participant-specific connectivity structure. In addition, the ME-VAR models can capture connectivity differences across experimental conditions and patient groups. The ME-VAR model directly decomposes the connectivity matrices into (i.) the condition-specific connectivity matrix, which is shared by all participants in the study (fixed effect) and (ii.) a participant-specific component (random effect) which accounts for between-subject variation in connectivity. An advantage of our approach is that it permits the use of both theoretical results on mixed effects models and existing statistical software when fitting the model. Another advantage of the proposed approach is that it provides improved estimates of the within-subject coefficients (the random effects) by pooling information across subjects in a single-stage rather than the usual two-stage approach. We illustrate the ME-VAR model on a functional MRI data set obtained to investigate brain connectivity in the prefrontal, pre-motor and parietal cortices while humans performed a motor-related, decision-making and action selection task.},

In studies of recognition memory, the capacity for recognizing a noun in a scrambled sentence decreases following the recognition that another noun has occurred before in the scrambled sentence (Dopkins \& Ngo, 2002). The results of the present study suggest that these two phenomena reflect the same recognition memory process. The results suggest further that this is not because participants in studies of anaphor comprehension ignore the discourse properties of the stimulus materials and treat them as lists of words upon which memory tests are to be given. These results suggest that recognition processes play a role in anaphor comprehension and that such processes are in part the means by which repeated-noun anaphors are identified as such.},

abstract = {When scientists from two or more disciplines work together on related problems, they often face what we call science friction'. As science becomes more data-driven, collaborative, and interdisciplinary, demand increases for interoperability among data, tools, and services. Metadata - usually viewed simply as data about data', describing objects such as books, journal articles, or datasets - serve key roles in interoperability. Yet we find that metadata may be a source of friction between scientific collaborators, impeding data sharing. We propose an alternative view of metadata, focusing on its role in an ephemeral process of scientific communication, rather than as an enduring outcome or product. We report examples of highly useful, yet ad hoc, incomplete, loosely structured, and mutable, descriptions of data found in our ethnographic studies of several large projects in the environmental sciences. Based on this evidence, we argue that while metadata products can be powerful resources, usually they must be supplemented with metadata processes. Metadata-as-process suggests the very large role of the ad hoc, the incomplete, and the unfinished in everyday scientific work.},

abstract = {In the present study, event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded to investigate the role of pitch accent and lexical tone in spoken discourse comprehension. Chinese was used as material to explore the potential difference in the nature and time course of brain responses to sentence meaning as indicated by pitch accent and to lexical meaning as indicated by tone. In both cases, the pitch contour of critical words was varied. The results showed that both inconsistent pitch accent and inconsistent lexical tone yielded N400 effects, and there was no interaction between them. The negativity evoked by inconsistent pitch accent had the some topography as that evoked by inconsistent lexical tone violation, with a maximum over central-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, the effect for the combined violations was the sum of effects for pure pitch accent and pure lexical tone violation. However, the effect for the lexical tone violation appeared approximately 90 ms earlier than the effect of the pitch accent violation. It is suggested that there might be a correspondence between the neural mechanism underlying pitch accent and lexical meaning processing in context. They both reflect the integration of the current information into a discourse context, independent of whether the current information was sentence meaning indicated by accentuation, or lexical meaning indicated by tone. In addition, lexical meaning was processed earlier than sentence meaning conveyed by pitch accent during spoken language processing.},

thisquestion by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of

scanpaths, these studies relied on simplifieddependent measures that
are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address thetheoretical
question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifiesscanpath
similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies
associated withreanalysis that went undetected in a previously published
data set (Meseguer et al., 2002).One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing
of the sentence, a strategy that has beendiscussed in the literature
(Frazier \& Rayner, 1982); however, readers differedtremendously in
how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results
suggestthat the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts
different strategies whenconfronted with the disambiguating material

abstract = {To study the neural bases of semantic composition in language processing without confounds from syntactic composition, recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies have investigated the processing of constructions that exhibit some type of syntax-semantics mismatch. The most studied case of such a mismatch is complement coercion; expressions such as the author began the book, where an entity-denoting noun phrase is coerced into an eventive meaning in order to match the semantic properties of the event-selecting verb (e.g., 'the author began reading/writing the book'). These expressions have been found to elicit increased activity in the Anterior Midline Field (AMF), an MEG component elicited at frontomedial sensors at approximately 400 ms after the onset of the coercing noun [Pylkk\"{a}nen, L., \& McElree, B. (2007). An MEG study of silent meaning. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 11]. Thus, the AMF constitutes a potential neural correlate of coercion. However, the AMF was generated in ventromedial prefrontal regions, which are heavily associated with decision-making. This raises the possibility that, instead of semantic processing, the AMF effect may have been related to the experimental task, which was a sensicality judgment. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the effect of coercion when subjects were simply reading for comprehension, without a decision-task. Additionally, we investigated coercion in an adjectival rather than a verbal environment to further generalize the findings. Our results show that an AMF effect of coercion is elicited without a decision-task and that the effect also extends to this novel syntactic environment. We conclude that in addition to its role in non-linguistic higher cognition, ventromedial prefrontal regions contribute to the resolution of syntax-semantics mismatches in language processing.},

abstract = {The research reported here is a systematic investigation of what competent, native speakers of English, native to contemporary syntactic theory, judge to be grammatically acceptable patterns of co-reference involving names and pronouns. Its central goal is the specification of syntactic factors that influence co-reference within and between sentences. The results show that naive subjects have consistent intuitions of grammaticality that agree with some principles of contemporary binding theory. The results also show that naive subjects diverge substantially from syntactic theorists in other judgments of grammaticality. In particular, subjects have strong intuitions that reflexives and pronouns are in complementary distribution, a fact that supports contemporary syntactic theory. Beyond that domain, subjects' judgments of co-reference in name-pronoun, name-name, and pronoun-name sequences are systematically influenced by syntactic structure in ways that are not consistent with syntactic theory. Co-reference in name-pronoun sequences is generally quite acceptable but becomes more acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the name increases. Co-reference in name-name sequences is only moderately acceptable and becomes less acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the first name increases. Co-reference in pronoun-name sequences is generally unacceptable and is only weakly influenced by the kinds of syntactic prominence that affect other relations of co-reference. We account for these results through the elaboration of a model of the process by which syntactic representations are mapped onto a representation of discourse capable of expressing generalizations about co-reference both intra-sententially and inter-sententially.},

Such differences in ﬁxation probability may imply a selection effect for multivariate analyses of eyemovement corpora if selection effects correlate with word properties of skipped words. For example, with fewer ﬁxations on short and highly frequent words the power to detect parafoveal-on-foveal effects is reduced. We demonstrate that increasing the ﬁxation probability on function words with a manipulation of the expected difﬁculty and frequency of questions reduces an age difference in skipping probability (i.e., old adults become comparable to young adults) and helps to uncover signiﬁcant parafoveal-on-foveal effects in this group of old adults. We discuss implications for the comparison of results of eye-movement research based on multivariate analysis of corpus data with those from display-contingent manipulations of target words.},

@article{Martin2012a,
abstract = {Successful language use requires access to products of past processing within an evolving discourse. A central issue for any neurocognitive theory of language then concerns the role of memory variables during language processing. Under a cue-based retrieval account of language comprehension, linguistic dependency resolution (e.g., retrieving antecedents) is subject to interference from other information in the sentence, especially information that occurs between the words that form the dependency (e.g., between the antecedent and the retrieval site). Retrieval interference may then shape processing complexity as a function of the match of the information at retrieval with the antecedent versus other recent or similar items in memory. To address these issues, we studied the online processing of ellipsis in Castilian Spanish, a language with morphological gender agreement. We recorded event-related brain potentials while participants read sentences containing noun-phrase ellipsis indicated by the determiner otro/a ('another'). These determiners had a grammatically correct or incorrect gender with respect to their antecedent nouns that occurred earlier in the sentence. Moreover, between each antecedent and determiner, another noun phrase occurred that was structurally unavailable as an antecedent and that matched or mismatched the gender of the antecedent (i.e., a local agreement attractor). In contrast to extant P600 results on agreement violation processing, and inconsistent with predictions from neurocognitive models of sentence processing, grammatically incorrect determiners evoked a sustained, broadly distributed negativity compared to correct ones between 400 and 1000ms after word onset, possibly related to sustained negativities as observed for referential processing difficulties. Crucially, this effect was modulated by the attractor: an increased negativity was observed for grammatically correct determiners that did not match the gender of the attractor, suggesting that structurally unavailable noun phrases were at least temporarily considered for grammatically correct ellipsis. These results constitute the first ERP evidence for cue-based retrieval interference during comprehension of grammatical sentences.},

abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the
macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas
has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary
of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other
modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing
large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the
application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization
of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system,
which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively
visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as
visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs.
A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association
areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number
of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual
degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority
of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are
also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual
system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical,
transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal
lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified
pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity
of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between
areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor
areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent
studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10
levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels
if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the
bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top.
Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing
streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental
organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related
to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and
parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships
(about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into
this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances,
though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions
to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities
in the reported assignment.},

a valuation of similarity and difference, they do not readily provide
a statistical test of similarity or difference. Furthermore, pairwise
alignment scores cannot be used to compare groups of scan patterns
directly. Using a statistic that compiles these pairwise alignment
scores, a statistical evaluation of similarity can be made by repeatedly
computing scores from different permutations of scan pattern groupings.
This test produces a p-value as a level of statistical significance.},

abstract = {For many types of behaviours, it is necessary to monitor the position
or movement of objects that are temporarily occluded. The primate
posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are active during
visual guidance tasks: in some cases, even if the visual target disappears
transiently. It has been proposed that activity of this sort could
be related to current or planned eye movements, but it might also
provide a more generalized abstract representation of the spatial
disposition of targets, even when they are not visible. We have recorded
from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual
stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context,
could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this
temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were
found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the
stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary. The
activity was thus present in the absence of either sensory input
or motor output, suggesting that it may indeed constitute a generalized
representation of target motion.},

abstract = {How does prior context influence lexical and discourse-level processing during real-time language comprehension? Experiment 1 examined whether the referential ambiguity introduced by a repeated, anaphoric expression had an immediate or delayed effect on lexical and discourse processing, using an eye-tracking-while-reading task. Eye movements indicated facilitated recognition of repeated expressions, suggesting that prior context can rapidly influence lexical processing. However, context effects at the discourse level affected later processing, appearing in longer regression-path durations 2 words after the anaphor and in greater rereading times of the antecedent expression. Experiments 2 and 3 explored the nature of this delay by examining the role of the preceding context in activating relevant representations. Offline and online interpretations confirmed that relevant referents were activated following the critical context. Nevertheless, their initial unavailability during comprehension suggests a robust temporal division between lexical and discourse-level processing.

@article{Jurafsky1996a,
abstract = {The problems of access retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar and disambiguation choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This paper presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I showthat thismotivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.},

abstract = {An analysis of the contributions of "omics technologies" to human health and clinical care needs to address the relationships between internal issues (e.g., methodological shortcomings in "omics" research and clinical biology) and external influences. Among the latter, monetization of intellectual property (IP) appears to be a powerful force favoring methodological limitations and an excessive reductionism and fragmentation of biological knowledge. Following economic successes in other industries (semiconductors, software, and "dot-coms"), monetization of IP tries to market small fragments of big research "puzzles"; the strategy seems partly responsible for the biotech industry having underperformed methodological, clinical, and economic expectations. Hence, internal, purely scientific reasons can hardly explain failures in the application of long-proven principles of clinical epidemiology to the discovery and validation of diagnostic and prognostic tests. Nevertheless, this paper also sketches methodological proposals that may help integrate microbiological, clinical, and environmental evidence. Clinical and epidemiological reasoning, knowledge, and methods need to be applied on a much wider scale than until now by "omics" studies that aim at making inferences relevant for human beings. Rather than adopting the values and norms of "science business," "omics research" could apply a diversity of clinicoepidemiological models favoring integrative research.},

Sentence-length ERPs showed several differences in the slow scalp potentials elicited by SO and SS sentences that were similar in their temporal dynamics to those elicited by the same stimuli in a word-by-word reading experiment, although the effects in the two modalities have non-identical distributions. Just as for written sentences, there was a large, fronto-central negativity beginning at the linguistically defined "gap" in the SO sentences; this effect was largest for listeners with above-median comprehension rates and is hypothesized to index changes in on-line processing demands during comprehension.},

two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion,
called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information
lost and gained in changing from clustering to clustering . The basic
properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds
of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the
new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric
on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability
of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter
properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing
comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we
present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is
the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both
aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence,
we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there
is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies
the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

@article{Benjamin:2009p9668,
abstract = {Due to a host of technological, interface, operational and workflow limitations, teleradiology and PACS/RIS were historically developed as separate systems serving different purposes. PACS/RIS handled local radiology storage and workflow management while teleradiology addressed remote access to images. Today advanced PACS/RIS support complete site radiology workflow for attending physicians, whether on-site or remote. In parallel, teleradiology has emerged into a service of providing remote, off-hours, coverage for emergency radiology and to a lesser extent subspecialty reading to subscribing sites and radiology groups. When attending radiologists use teleradiology for remote access to a site, they may share all relevant patient data and participate in the site's workflow like their on-site peers. The operation gets cumbersome and time consuming when these radiologists serve multi-sites, each requiring a different remote access, or when the sites do not employ the same PACS/RIS/Reporting Systems and do not share the same ownership. The least efficient operation is of teleradiology companies engaged in reading for multiple facilities. As these services typically employ non-local radiologists, they are allowed to share some of the available patient data necessary to provide an emergency report but, by enlarge, they do not share the workflow of the sites they serve. Radiology stakeholders usually prefer to have their own radiologists perform all radiology tasks including interpretation of off-hour examinations. It is possible with current technology to create a system that combines the benefits of local radiology services to multiple sites with the advantages offered by adding subspecialty and off-hours emergency services through teleradiology. Such a system increases efficiency for the radiology groups by enabling all users, regardless of location, to work "local" and fully participate in the workflow of every site. We refer to such a system as SuperPACS.},

abstract = {We examine recent concerns that averaged learning curves can present a distorted picture of individual learning. Analyses of practice curve data from a range of paradigms demonstrate that such concerns are well founded for fits of power and exponential functions when the arithmetic average is computed over participants. We also demonstrate that geometric averaging over participants does not, in general, avoid distortion. By contrast, we show that block averages of individual curves and similar smoothing techniques cause little or no distortion of functional form, while still providing the noise reduction benefits that motivate the use of averages. Our analyses are concerned mainly with the effects of averaging on the fit of exponential and power functions, but we also define general conditions that must be met by any set of functions to avoid distortion from averaging.},

They viewed a concurrent scene depicting a full glass of beer and an empty wine glass (amongst other things). There were more saccades towards the empty wine glass in the past tensed conditions than in the future tense conditions; the converse pattern obtained for looks towards the full glass of beer. We argue that these anticipatory eye movements reflect sensitivity to objects' affordances, and develop an account of the linkage between language processing and visual attention that can account not only for looks towards named objects, but also for those cases (including anticipatory eye movements) where attention is directed towards objects that are not being named.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce some mathematical and numerical tools to
analyze and interpret inhomogeneous quadratic forms. The resulting
characterization is in some aspects similar to that given by experimental
studies of cortical cells, making it particularly suitable for application
to second-order approximations and theoretical models of physiological
receptive fields. We first discuss two ways of analyzing a quadratic
form by visualizing the coefficients of its quadratic and linear
term directly and by considering the eigenvectors of its quadratic
term. We then present an algorithm to compute the optimal excitatory
and inhibitory stimuli, i.e. the stimuli that maximize and minimize
the considered quadratic form, respectively, given a fixed energy
constraint. The analysis of the optimal stimuli is completed by considering
their invariances, which are the transformations to which the quadratic
form is most insensitive. We introduce a test to determine which
of these are statistically significant. Next we propose a way to
measure the relative contribution of the quadratic and linear term
to the total output of the quadratic form. Furthermore, we derive
simpler versions of the above techniques in the special case of a
quadratic form without linear term and discuss the analysis of such
functions in previous theoretical and experimental studies. In the
final part of the paper we show that for each quadratic form it is
possible to build an equivalent two-layer neural network, which is
compatible with (but more general than) related networks used in
some recent papers and with the energy model of complex cells. We
show that the neural network is unique only up to an arbitrary orthogonal
transformation of the excitatory and inhibitory subunits in the first
layer. },

abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

abstract = {This paper describes a fully implemented, broad-coverage model of human syntactic processing. The model uses probabilistic parsing techniques, which combine phrase structure, lexical category, and limited subcategory probabilities with an incremental, left-to-right "pruning" mechanism based on cascaded Markov models. The parameters of the system are established through a uniform training algorithm, which determines maximum-likelihood estimates from a parsed corpus. The probabilistic parsing mechanism enables the system to achieve good accuracy on typical, "garden-variety" language (i.e., when tested on corpora). Furthermore, the incremental probabilistic ranking of the preferred analyses during parsing also naturally explains observed human behavior for a range of garden-path structures. We do not make strong psychological claims about the specific probabilistic mechanism discussed here, which is limited by a number of practical considerations. Rather, we argue incremental probabilistic parsing models are, in general, extremely well suited to explaining this dual nature-generally good and occasionally pathological-of human linguistic performance.},

abstract = {Four experiments were carried out to investigate how general knowledge about the stereo- typical gender of participants in a text in¯ uences comprehension. A self-paced reading task was used to present short texts comprising one, two, or three sentences. The ® rst sentence of each text introduced a stereotypically masculine or feminine participant (e.g. doctor, nurse), or a neutral one. The last sentence introduced a pronoun (he/she) that could match or mismatch the gender of the referent. The ® rst experiment, which was carried out in English, showed that reading times for the last sentence were longer when there was a mismatch than when there was a match between the gender of the pronoun in the last sentence and the stereotypical gender of the referent in the ® rst sentence. In contrast to English, the gender of the participant can be disambiguated by a preceding article (el/la ) in Spanish. The results of the second, third, and fourth experiments, which were carried out in Spanish, showed that reading times for the ® rst sentences were longer when there was a mismatch than when there was a match between the gender of the article and the stereotypical gender of the participant. However, reading times for the last sentences did not differ. Overall, the results suggest that information about the stereotypical gender of the participants in a text is incorporated into the representation as soon as it becomes available, and that it affects the ease with which the text is understood.},

The use of open materials by faculty is something of a continuum, with those who closely guard their intellectual property and privacy on one end, with faculty who seek out and use open content and technologies in the middle, and with those who actively contribute to open content on the other end. However, to say that concerns over intellectual property or privacy are the defining characteristics of open faculty would be a mistake. When I began writing this article about open faculty, it seemed like a straightforward topic. I've had a great deal of contact with faculty at workshops and conferences all over the United States, and I've seen firsthand how some faculty embrace open resources and some shy away from them. To prepare for my writing, I thought it would be best to have some in-depth conversations with faculty at various positions on the open faculty continuum. Interestingly, over the course of these conversations, I found it necessary to adjust my straightforward view of open faculty. For a while, I even thought I might just have to throw in the towel and quote Facebook's relationship status: It's complicated.},

abstract = {Evidence from recent experiments that monitored attention in clipart scenes during spoken com- prehension suggests that people preferably rely on non-stereotypical depicted events over stereotypical thematic knowledge for incremental interpretation. The Coordinated Interplay Account (Knoeferle Crocker, 2006) accounts for this preference through referential processing (e.g., the verb mediates a depicted event) and the preferred use of scene event information that is associated with the referent (e.g., the agent of the depicted event). Three eye-tracking experiments examined the generality of this account. While the rapid use of depicted events was replicated in all three studies, the preference to rely on them was modulated by the decay of events that were no longer co-present. Our findings motivate the extension of the Coordinated Interplay Account with an ex- plicit working memory. The coordinated interplay mechanism together with working memory and decay, is shown to account for the influence of scene-derived versus stored knowledge both when events are co-present and when they have recently been perceived.

We used a display-change paradigm in which we masked words beyond the three-to-four-character range to the left of a fixation. We hypothesized that if reading behavior was affected by this manipulation before regressions but not before progressions, we would have evidence that the perceptual span extends farther left before leftward eye movements. We observed significantly shorter regressive saccades and longer fixation and gaze durations in the masked condition when a regression was executed. Forward saccades were entirely unaffected by the manipulations. We concluded that the perceptual span during reading changes, depending on the direction of a following saccade.},

@article{Miller:1982,
abstract = {Many models of divided attention assume that signals presented on different channels produce separate activations, any one of which can initiate a response. According to these models, detection responses are especially fast when signals are presented on two channels at the same time because the system can detect a signal in either of two ways. Such models predict a testable relation among reaction time distributions for conditions in which a single signal is presented as compared with a condition in which two signals are presented, and this prediction is tested in two tasks. A bimodal detection task required a simple speeded response to either a visual or an auditory signal. A letter search task required a choice response depending on whether or not a two-letter display included the signal letter"A." Data from both tasks are inconsistent with the prediction. When two signals are presented, responses are faster than separate-activation models can explain. The results favor "coactivation" models, in which signals presented on different channels contribute to a common pool of activation that initiates a response.},

abstract = {The physical energy that we refer to as a word, whether in isolation or embedded in sentences, takes its meaning from the knowledge stored in our brains through a lifetime of experience. Much empirical evidence indicates that, although this knowledge can be used fairly flexibly, it is functionally organized in 'semantic memory' along a number of dimensions, including similarity and association. Here, we review recent findings using an electrophysiological brain component, the N400, that reveal the nature and timing of semantic memory use during language comprehension. These findings show that the organization of semantic memory has an inherent impact on sentence processing. The left hemisphere, in particular, seems to capitalize on the organization of semantic memory to pre-activate the meaning of forthcoming words, even if this strategy fails at times. In addition, these electrophysiological results support a view of memory in which world knowledge is distributed across multiple, plastic-yet-structured, largely modality-specific processing areas, and in which meaning is an emergent, temporally extended process, influenced by experience, context, and the nature of the brain itself.},

is slow and modulatory, whereas feedforward connections carry a rapid
drive to their target neurons. Recent results from our laboratory
showed a very rapid effect of feedback connections on the visual
responses of neurons in lower order areas. We wanted to determine
whether such a rapid action is mediated by fast conducting axons.
Using electrical stimulation, we compared the conduction velocities
along feedforward and feedback axons between areas V1 and V2 of the
macaque monkey. We conclude that feedback and feedforward connections
between V1 and V2 have comparable fast conduction velocities (around
3.5 m/s).},

We report results from an eye-tracking study showing that on encountering a pronoun that has no prior antecedent (compared to cases where there is an explicit prior antecedent), readers experience immediate difficulty whether or not the pronoun appears in a preposed subordinate clause, suggesting that attempted incremental interpretation is not suspended in these cases.},

abstract = {The volume of publicly available genomic scale data is increasing. Genomic datasets in public repositories are annotated with free-text fields describing the pathological state of the studied sample. These annotations are not mapped to concepts in any ontology, making it difficult to integrate these datasets across repositories. We have previously developed methods to map text-annotations of tissue microarrays to concepts in the NCI thesaurus and SNOMED-CT. In this work we generalize our methods to map text annotations of gene expression datasets to concepts in the UMLS. We demonstrate the utility of our methods by processing annotations of datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus. We demonstrate that we enable ontology-based querying and integration of tissue and gene expression microarray data. We enable identification of datasets on specific diseases across both repositories. Our approach provides the basis for ontology-driven data integration for translational research on gene and protein expression data. Based on this work we have built a prototype system for ontology based annotation and indexing of biomedical data. The system processes the text metadata of diverse resource elements such as gene expression data sets, descriptions of radiology images, clinical-trial reports, and PubMed article abstracts to annotate and index them with concepts from appropriate ontologies. The key functionality of this system is to enable users to locate biomedical data resources related to particular ontology concepts.},

four points. The first twocounterclaims made by Lewis (2000): (1)
that the availability of alternative structures should notvary as
a function of the disambiguating material in some ranked parallel
models; and (2) that parallel models predict a slow down during the
ambiguous region for more syntactically ambiguousstructures. Our
other points concern potential methods for seeking experimental evidence

plausibility of a secondary structure in theambiguous region (Pearlmutter

Relational integration predicted reasoning ability at least as well as the storage-and-processing construct. Supervision, measured as specific switch costs, was not related to intelligence, but general switch costs were moderately correlated to the reasoning factor. The results question the view of working memory as a device for storage and processing, and the executive-attention account of working memory. They are better explained by theories describing working memory as a system for building relational representations through temporary bindings between component representations.},

with attention: the mediating neural mechanisms should include a

object from among others in the scene. Here we test whether neurons
in inferior temporal cortex, an area known to be important for high-level
visual processing, might provide these components. Monkeys were presented
with a complex picture (the cue) to hold in memory during a delay
period. The cue initiated activity that persisted through the delay
among the neurons that were tuned to its features. The monkeys were
then given 2-5 choice pictures and were required to make an eye movement
to the one (the target) that matched the cue. About 90-120 milliseconds
before the onset of the eye movement to the target, responses to
non-targets were suppressed and the neuronal response was dominated
by the target. The results suggest that inferior temporal cortex
is involved in selecting the objects to which we attend and foveate.},

abstract = {This article compares several methods of presenting text, including a new paradigm that produces reading-time data with many of the characteristics of naturally occurring eye-fixation data. In the new paradigm, called the moving window condition, a reader presses a button to see each successive work in a text, and the previous work is removed when a new work appears. The words appear in the same position that they would in normal test, and word-length information is available in peripheral vision. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the results obtained by monitoring the eye fixations of subjects reading normal text. The word-level effects are generally similar. Readers pause longer on longer words, on less frequent words, on words that introduce a new topic, and at ends of sentences. The results suggest that readers initiate thr processing of each word as soon as they encounter it rather than buffer words and delay processing. Also considered are two other reading-time paradigms, one in which words are cumulatively displayed on the screen and one in which each successive word is presented at the same location on the screen. Finally, we consider how the tendency to immediately process text might interact with other techniques for text presentation, such as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) condition, and we generate predictions about the nature and limits of the method.},

abstract = {Modularity is a concept central to cognitive science, and Fodor's analysis of cognitive modularity in his book The Modularity Of Mind has been widely influential - but also widely misunderstood. It is often claimed that the possession of some or other system-property is a necessary condition for that system to be modular in Fodor's sense, but Fodor made it clear that he was not proposing a definition of modularity, nor proposing any necessary conditions for the applicability of the term. He was simply suggesting a number of system properties that are typical of modular systems. I argue that it is nevertheless possible to derive a useful definition of modularity from the kinds of arguments put forward by Fodor: A cognitive system is modular when and only when it is domain-specific. Given any such proposed module, the other features of modularity discussed by Fodor should be dealt with as empirical issues: for each feature (innateness, for example), it is an empirical question whether or not the proposed module has that feature.},

Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these initiatives because data can be shared in such a variety of mechanisms and locations. We propose a novel approach to finding shared datasets: using NLP techniques to identify declarations of dataset sharing within the full text of primary research articles. Using regular expression patterns and machine learning algorithms on open access biomedical literature, our system was able to identify 61\% of articles with shared datasets with 80\% precision. A simpler version of our classifier achieved higher recall (86\%), though lower precision (49\%). We believe our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and hope to inspire further study of dataset retrieval techniques and policy evaluation.},

abstract = {The physical energy that we refer to as a word, whether in isolation or embedded in sentences, takes its meaning from the knowledge stored in our brains through a lifetime of experience. Much empirical evidence indicates that, although this knowledge can be used fairly flexibly, it is functionally organized in 'semantic memory' along a number of dimensions, including similarity and association. Here, we review recent findings using an electrophysiological brain component, the N400, that reveal the nature and timing of semantic memory use during language comprehension. These findings show that the organization of semantic memory has an inherent impact on sentence processing. The left hemisphere, in particular, seems to capitalize on the organization of semantic memory to pre-activate the meaning of forthcoming words, even if this strategy fails at times. In addition, these electrophysiological results support a view of memory in which world knowledge is distributed across multiple, plastic-yet-structured, largely modality-specific processing areas, and in which meaning is an emergent, temporally extended process, influenced by experience, context, and the nature of the brain itself.},

abstract = {The authors examined word skipping in reading in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, skipping rates were higher for a preview of a predictable word than for a visually similar nonword, indicating there is full recognition in parafoveal vision. In Experiment 2, foveal load was manipulated by varying the frequency of the word preceding either a 3-letter target word or a misspelled preview. There was again a higher skipping rate for a correct preview and a lower skipping rate when there was a high foveal load, but there was no interaction, and the pattern of effects in fixation times was the same as in the skipping data. Experiment 2 also showed significant skipping of nonwords similar to the target word, indicating skipping based on partial information.},

@article{Gennari:2007p694,
abstract = {The meaning of a word usually depends on the context in which it occurs. This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in computing word meanings that change as a function of syntactic context. Current semantic processing theories suggest that word meanings are retrieved from diverse cortical regions storing sensory-motor and other types of semantic information and are further integrated with context in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Our fMRI data indicate that brain activity in an area sensitive to motion and action semantics--the posterior middle temporal gyrus (PMTG)--is modulated by a word's syntactic context. Ambiguous words such as bowl were presented in minimal disambiguating contexts indicating object (the bowl) or action (to bowl) meanings and were compared to low-ambiguity controls. Ambiguous words elicited more activity than low-ambiguity controls in LIFG and various meaning-related areas such as PMTG. Critically, ambiguous words also elicited more activity in to--contexts than the--contexts in PMTG and LIFG, suggesting that contextual integration strengthened the action meaning in both areas. The pattern of results suggests that the activation of lexical information in PMTG was sensitive to contextual disambiguating information and that processing context-dependent meanings may involve interactions between frontal and posterior areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines improved clinical trials reporting and subject attrition, which may undermine the credibility of published randomized clinical trials (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Published RCTs reported in two major medical journals before and after the CONSORT guidelines were systematically reviewed; one used the CONSORT statement (JAMA) and one did not (NEJM). RESULTS: The quality of RCT reporting improved for both journals, but JAMA showed more significant and consistent improvements in all aspects of RCT reporting. Subject attrition was better accounted for after the publication of CONSORT, although the attrition rates for various reasons actually increased. Attrition due to unknown reasons, as a percentage of total attrition, declined dramatically, from 68.7\% pre-CONSORT to 13.0\% post-CONSORT. CONCLUSIONS: Attrition of study subjects remains a serious problem in RCTs. Bias from selective attrition can undermine the presumptive scientific advantage of RCTs. The CONSORT guidelines improved RCT reporting when they were implemented but did not substantially improve reported attrition rates.},
